# :pizza: Hacktoberfest 2019 :beer:

It's that time of the year again!
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is here, and `gensim` needs **your** help.
We've prepared a list of good issues to work on: [gensim hacktoberfest issues](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/labels/hacktoberfest).

If the learning curve for `gensim` is a bit steep, give the [smart_open](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open) repository a try.
`smart_open` is an important dependency of `gensim`: it performs file I/O over a variety of protocols and formats.
There's also a list of Hacktoberfest-friendly issues to work on [smart_open hacktoberfest issues](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open/labels/hacktoberfest).

Of course, we welcome contributions on any of the existing issues, not just the ones labeled `hacktoberfest`.
Just be sure that no-one else is already working on it first.

Furthermore, we also welcome contributions not connected to an existing issue.
This includes things like fixing typos in documentation, docstrings, etc.
If you make such contributions, please make the motivation behind the contribution clear.
Please avoid making innocuous changes without sufficient motivation (e.g. changing code formatting, etc).
