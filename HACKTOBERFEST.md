# :pizza: Hacktoberfest 2019 :beer:

It's that time of the year again!
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is here, and `gensim` needs **your** help.
We've prepared a list of good issues to work on [here](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/labels/hacktoberfest).

If the learning curve for `gensim` is a bit steep, give the [smart_open](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open) repository a try.
`smart_open` is an important dependency of `gensim`: it performs file I/O over a variety of protocols and formats.
There's also a list of Hacktoberfest-friendly issues to work on [here](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open/labels/hacktoberfest).

Of course, we welcome contributions on any of the existing issues, not just the ones labeled `hacktoberfest`.
Just be sure that no-one else is already working on it first.

Furthermore, we also welcome contributions not connected to an existing issues.
