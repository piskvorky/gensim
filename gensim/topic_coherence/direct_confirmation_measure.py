def log_conditional_probability(segmented_topics, accumulator, with_std=False, with_support=False):
    r"""Calculate the log-conditional-probability measure which is used by coherence measures such as `U_mass`.
    This is defined as :math:`m_{lc}(S_i) = log \frac{P(W', W^{*}) + \epsilon}{P(W^{*})}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    segmented_topics : list of lists of (int, int)
        Output from the :func:`~gensim.topic_coherence.segmentation.s_one_pre`,
        :func:`~gensim.topic_coherence.segmentation.s_one_one`.
    accumulator : :class:`~gensim.topic_coherence.text_analysis.InvertedIndexAccumulator`
        Word occurrence accumulator from :mod:`gensim.topic_coherence.probability_estimation`.
    with_std : bool, optional
        True to also include standard deviation across topic segment sets in addition to the mean coherence
        for each topic.
    with_support : bool, optional
        True to also include support across topic segments. The support is defined as the number of pairwise
        similarity comparisons were used to compute the overall topic coherence.

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        Log conditional probabilities measurement for each topic.

    Notes
    -----
    If `normalize=False`:

    If `normalize=True`:
        Calculate the normalized-log-ratio-measure, popularly knowns as **NPMI**
        which is used by coherence measures such as `c_v`.
