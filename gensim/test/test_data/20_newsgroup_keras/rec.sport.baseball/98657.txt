I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati.
This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the offseason.
Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now.
The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent.
#1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected.
Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback.
Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half.
This may be Ben's year.
I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August.
I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.
Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91.
The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters.
Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant.
The rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????.
Olson is an interesting case.
Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
three pop outs?
You never know.
he way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in)
Baltimore
New York
Toronto
Milwaukee
Cleveland
Boston
Detroit
(The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind.
One of these 4 will definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :).
I feel that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)
