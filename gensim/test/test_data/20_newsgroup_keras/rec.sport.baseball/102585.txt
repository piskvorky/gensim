I say buy out Henderson's contract and let him go bag groceries.
Next season, you'll be able to sign him for nothing.
That goes for any bitching ball player.
I doubt Henderson would clear waivers.
And if he did, he would instantly be signed for the major league minimum, with Oakland picking up the remaining $3 million tab.
Some GMs value on-field performance too...
