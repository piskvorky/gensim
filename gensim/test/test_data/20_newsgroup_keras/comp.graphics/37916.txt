I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor).
Could anyone tell me where I can FTP the source code and which is the newest version around?
Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman is like SIPP?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make a program that creates the image
