Hello, I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am developing on an HP730 (UNIX) workstation.
I would greatly appreciate information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are easily accessible from the UNIX environment.
The names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful.
Please respond via email; I will post a summary if there is sufficient interest.
P.S.  I have found several impressive systems for IBM PC's, but I would like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate PC if at all possible.
