#include "EMD_DEFS.hpp"
#include "emd_hat.hpp"

//=============================================================================
// This interface is similar to Rubner's interface. See:
// http://www.cs.duke.edu/~tomasi/software/emd.htm
// With the following changes;
// 1. Weights of signature should be of type NUM_T (see emd_hat.hpp)
// 2. Return value of the distance function (func) should be of type NUM_T 
// 3. Return value of the emd_hat_signature_interface function is NUM_T 
// 4. The function does not return a flow (I may add this in future, if needed)
// 5. The function also gets the penalty for extra mass - if you want metric property
//    should be at least half the diameter of the space (maximum possible distance
//    between any two points). In Rubner's code this is implicitly 0. 
// 6. The result is not normalized with the flow.
//
// To get the same results as Rubner's code you should set extra_mass_penalty to 0,
// and divide by the minimum of the sum of the two signature's weights. However, I
// suggest not to do this as you lose the metric property and more importantly, in my
// experience the performance is better with emd_hat. for more on the difference
// between emd and emd_hat, see the paper:
//  A Linear Time Histogram Metric for Improved SIFT Matching
//  Ofir Pele, Michael Werman
//  ECCV 2008
//
// To get shorter running time, set the ground distance function (func) to
// be a thresholded distance. For example: min( L2, T ). Where T is some threshold.
// Note that the running time is shorter with smaller T values. Note also that
// thresholding the distance will probably increase accuracy. Finally, a thresholded
// metric is also a metric. See paper:
//  Fast and Robust Earth Mover's Distances
//	Ofir Pele, Michael Werman
//  ICCV 2009
//
// If you use this code, please cite the papers.
