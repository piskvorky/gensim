/// Fastest version of EMD. Also, in my experience metric ground distance yields better
/// performance.
///
/// Required params:
/// P,Q - Two histograms of size N
/// C - The NxN matrix of the ground distance between bins of P and Q. Must be a metric. I
///     recommend it to be a thresholded metric (which is also a metric, see ICCV paper).
///
/// Optional params:
/// extra_mass_penalty - The penalty for extra mass - If you want the
///                     resulting distance to be a metric, it should be
///                     at least half the diameter of the space (maximum
///                     possible distance between any two points). If you
///                     want partial matching you can set it to zero (but
///                     then the resulting distance is not guaranteed to be a metric).
///                     Default value is -1 which means 1*max_element_in_C
/// F - *F is filled with flows or nothing happens to F. See template param FLOW_TYPE.
///     Note that EMD and EMD-HAT does not necessarily have a unique flow solution.
///     We assume *F is already allocated and has enough space and is initialized to zeros.
///     See also flow_utils.hpp file for flow-related utils.
///     Default value: NULL and then FLOW_TYPE must be NO_FLOW.
///
/// Required template params:
/// NUM_T - the type of the histogram bins count (should be one of: int, long int, long long int, double)
///
/// Optional template params:
/// FLOW_TYPE == NO_FLOW - does nothing with the given F.
///           == WITHOUT_TRANSHIPMENT_FLOW - fills F with the flows between bins connected
///              with edges smaller than max(C).
///           == WITHOUT_EXTRA_MASS_FLOW - fills F with the flows between all bins, except the flow
///              to the extra mass bin.
///           Note that if F is the default NULL then FLOW_TYPE must be NO_FLOW.
