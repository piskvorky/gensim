"""
Text corpora usually reside on disk, as text files in one format or another
In a common scenario, we need to build a dictionary (a `word->integer id`
mapping), which is then used to construct sparse bag-of-word vectors
(= sequences of `(word_id, word_weight)` 2-tuples).

This module provides some code scaffolding to simplify this pipeline. For
example, given a corpus where each document is a separate line in file on disk,
you would override the `TextCorpus.get_texts` method to read one line=document
at a time, process it (lowercase, tokenize, whatever) and yield it as a sequence
of words.

Overriding `get_texts` is enough; you can then initialize the corpus with e.g.
`MyTextCorpus(bz2.BZ2File('mycorpus.txt.bz2'))` and it will behave correctly like a
corpus of sparse vectors. The `__iter__` methods is automatically set up, and
dictionary is automatically populated with all `word->id` mappings.

The resulting object can be used as input to all gensim models (TFIDF, LSI, ...),
serialized with any format (Matrix Market, SvmLight, Blei's LDA-C format etc).

See the `gensim.test.test_miislita.CorpusMiislita` class for a simple example.
