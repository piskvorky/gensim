    """
    Corpus in matrix market format

    Wrap a term-document matrix on disk (in matrix-market format), and present it
    as an object which supports iteration over the rows (~documents).

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_docs : int
        number of documents in market matrix file
    num_terms : int
        number of terms
    num_nnz : int
        number of non-zero terms

    Notes
    ----------
    Note that the file is read into memory one document at a time, not the whole
    matrix at once (unlike scipy.io.mmread). This allows us to process corpora
    which are larger than the available RAM.

    """

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : string or file-like
            string (file path) or a file-like object that supports
            `seek()` (e.g. gzip.GzipFile, bz2.BZ2File). File-like objects are
            not closed automatically.

        Iterate through vectors from underlying matrix

        ------
        list of (termid, val)
            "vector" of terms for next document in matrix
            vector of terms is represented as a list of (termid, val) tuples

        Notes
        ------
        Note that the total number of vectors returned is always equal to the
        number of rows specified in the header; empty documents are inserted and
