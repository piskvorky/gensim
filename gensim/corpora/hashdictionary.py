"""
This module implements the `"hashing trick" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashing-Trick>`_ --
a mapping between words and their integer ids using a fixed, static mapping. The
static mapping has a constant memory footprint, regardless of the number of word-types (features)
in your corpus, so it's suitable for processing extremely large corpora.

The ids are computed as `hash(word) % id_range`, where `hash` is a user-configurable
function (adler32 by default). Using HashDictionary, new words can be represented immediately,
without an extra pass through the corpus to collect all the ids first. This is another
advantage: HashDictionary can be used with non-repeatable (once-only) streams of documents.

A disadvantage of HashDictionary is that, unlike plain :class:`Dictionary`, several words may map
to the same id, causing hash collisions. The word<->id mapping is no longer a bijection.
