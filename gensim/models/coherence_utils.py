"""
This part contains functions to compute confirmation on a pair of words or word subsets.
The advantage of indirect confirmation measure is that it computes similarity of words in W' and
W* with respect to direct confirmations to all words. Eg. Suppose x and z are both competing
brands of cars, which semantically support each other. However, both brands are seldom mentioned
together in documents in the reference corpus. But their confirmations to other words like “road”
or “speed” do strongly correlate. This would be reflected by an indirect confirmation measure.
Thus, indirect confirmation measures may capture semantic support that direct measures would miss.

The formula used to compute indirect confirmation measure is:

m_{sim}_{(m, \gamma)}(W', W*) =
    s_{sim}(\vec{V}^{\,}_{m,\gamma}(W'), \vec{V}^{\,}_{m,\gamma}(W*))

where s_sim can be cosine, dice or jaccard similarity and

\vec{V}^{\,}_{m,\gamma}(W') =
    \Bigg \{{\sum_{w_{i} \in W'}^{ } m(w_{i}, w_{j})^{\gamma}}\Bigg \}_{j = 1,...,|W|}

Here 'm' is the direct confirmation measure used.
