"""
Author-topic model in Python.

This module trains the author-topic model on documents and corresponding author-document
dictionaries. The training is online and is constant in memory w.r.t. the number of
documents. The model is *not* constant in memory w.r.t. the number of authors.

The model can be updated with additional documents after training has been completed. It is
also possible to continue training on the existing data.

The model is closely related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The AuthorTopicModel class
inherits the LdaModel class, and its usage is thus similar.

The model was introduced by Rosen-Zvi and co-authors in 2004 and is described in [1]_
and a tutorial for using Author-topic model can be found at [2]_.

        """
        Train the model with new documents, by EM-iterating over `corpus` until
        the topics converge (or until the maximum number of allowed iterations
        is reached). `corpus` must be an iterable (repeatable stream of documents),

        This update also supports updating an already trained model (`self`)
        with new documents from `corpus`; the two models are then merged in
        proportion to the number of old vs. new documents. This feature is still
        experimental for non-stationary input streams.

        For stationary input (no topic drift in new documents), on the other hand,
        this equals the online update of Hoffman et al. and is guaranteed to
        converge for any `decay` in (0.5, 1.0>. Additionally, for smaller
        `corpus` sizes, an increasing `offset` may be beneficial (see
        Table 1 in Hoffman et al.)

        If update is called with authors that already exist in the model, it will
        resume training on not only new documents for that author, but also the
        previously seen documents. This is necessary for those authors' topic
        distributions to converge.

        Every time `update(corpus, author2doc)` is called, the new documents are
        to appended to all the previously seen documents, and author2doc is
        combined with the previously seen authors.

        To resume training on all the data seen by the model, simply call
        `update()`.

        It is not possible to add new authors to existing documents, as all
        documents in `corpus` are assumed to be new documents.

        Parameters
        ----------
        corpus : iterable of list of (int, number)
            The corpus with which the author-topic model should be updated.
        author2doc : dict of (str: list of ints)
            A dictionary where keys are the names of authors and values are lists of
            documents that the author contributes to.
        doc2author : dict of (int: list of str)
            A dictionary where the keys are document IDs and the values are lists of author names.
        chunksize : int
            Controls the size of the mini-batches.
        decay : float
            Controls how old documents are forgotten.
        offset : float
            Controls down-weighting of iterations.
        passes : int
            Number of times the model makes a pass over the entire training data.
        update_every : int
            Make updates in topic probaility for latest mini-batch.
        eval_every : int
            Calculate and estimate log perplexity for latest mini-batch.
        iterations : int
            Maximum number of times the model loops over each document
        gamma_threshold : float
            Threshold value of gamma(topic difference between consecutive two topics)
            until which the iterations continue.
        chunks_as_numpy : bool
            Whether each chunk passed to `.inference` should be a np
            array of not. np can in some settings turn the term IDs
            into floats, these will be converted back into integers in
            inference, which incurs a performance hit. For distributed
            computing it may be desirable to keep the chunks as np
            arrays.

        Estimate the variational bound of documents from `corpus`:
        E_q[log p(corpus)] - E_q[log q(corpus)]

        There are basically two use cases of this method:
        1. `chunk` is a subset of the training corpus, and `chunk_doc_idx` is provided,
        indicating the indexes of the documents in the training corpus.
        2. `chunk` is a test set (held-out data), and author2doc and doc2author
        corrsponding to this test set are provided. There must not be any new authors
        passed to this method. `chunk_doc_idx` is not needed in this case.

        Parameters
        ----------
        chunk : int
            The chunk numer of the sparse document vector on which inference needs to be done.
        author2doc : dict of (str: list of ints)
            A dictionary where keys are the names of authors and values are lists of
            documents that the author contributes to.
        doc2author : dict of (int: list of str)
            A dictionary where the keys are document IDs and the values are lists of author names.
        chunk_doc_idx : numpy.ndarray
            Assigns the value for document index.
        subsample_ratio : float, optional
            Used for calculation of word score for estimation of variational bound.
        
        Returns
        -------
        float
            Value of variational bound score.
