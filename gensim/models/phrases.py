"""
Automatically detect common phrases (multiword expressions) from a stream of sentences.

The phrases are collocations (frequently co-occurring tokens). See [1]_ for the
exact formula.

For example, if your input stream (=an iterable, with each value a list of token strings) looks like:

>>> print(list(sentence_stream))
[[u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new', u'york', u'was', u'there'],
 [u'machine', u'learning', u'can', u'be', u'useful', u'sometimes'],
 ...,
]

you'd train the detector with:

>>> phrases = Phrases(sentence_stream)

and then create a performant Phraser object to transform any sentence (list of token strings) using the standard gensim syntax:

>>> bigram = Phraser(phrases)
>>> sent = [u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new', u'york', u'was', u'there']
>>> print(bigram[sent])
[u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new_york', u'was', u'there']

(note `new_york` became a single token). As usual, you can also transform an entire
sentence stream using:

>>> print(list(bigram[any_sentence_stream]))
[[u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new_york', u'was', u'there'],
 [u'machine_learning', u'can', u'be', u'useful', u'sometimes'],
 ...,
]

You can also continue updating the collocation counts with new sentences, by:

>>> bigram.add_vocab(new_sentence_stream)

These **phrase streams are meant to be used during text preprocessing, before
converting the resulting tokens into vectors using `Dictionary`**. See the
:mod:`gensim.models.word2vec` module for an example application of using phrase detection.

The detection can also be **run repeatedly**, to get phrases longer than
two tokens (e.g. `new_york_times`):

>>> trigram = Phrases(bigram[sentence_stream])
>>> sent = [u'the', u'new', u'york', u'times', u'is', u'a', u'newspaper']
>>> print(trigram[bigram[sent]])
[u'the', u'new_york_times', u'is', u'a', u'newspaper']

The common_terms parameter add a way to give special treatment to common terms (aka stop words)
such that their presence between two words
won't prevent bigram detection.
It allows to detect expressions like "bank of america" or "eye of the beholder".

>>> common_terms = ["of", "with", "without", "and", "or", "the", "a"]
>>> ct_phrases = Phrases(sentence_stream, common_terms=common_terms)

The phraser will of course inherit the common_terms from Phrases.

>>> ct_bigram = Phraser(ct_phrases)
>>> sent = [u'the', u'mayor', u'shows', u'his', u'lack', u'of', u'interest']
>>> print(bigram[sent])
[u'the', u'mayor', u'shows', u'his', u'lack_of_interest']

        Initialize the model from an iterable of `sentences`. Each sentence must be
        a list of words (unicode strings) that will be used for training.

        The `sentences` iterable can be simply a list, but for larger corpora,
        consider a generator that streams the sentences directly from disk/network,
        without storing everything in RAM. See :class:`BrownCorpus`,
        :class:`Text8Corpus` or :class:`LineSentence` in the :mod:`gensim.models.word2vec`
        module for such examples.

        `min_count` ignore all words and bigrams with total collected count lower
        than this.

        `threshold` represents a score threshold for forming the phrases (higher means
        fewer phrases). A phrase of words `a` followed by `b` is accepted if the score of the
        phrase is greater than threshold. see the `scoring' setting

        `max_vocab_size` is the maximum size of the vocabulary. Used to control
        pruning of less common words, to keep memory under control. The default
        of 40M needs about 3.6GB of RAM; increase/decrease `max_vocab_size` depending
        on how much available memory you have.

        `delimiter` is the glue character used to join collocation tokens, and
        should be a byte string (e.g. b'_').

        `scoring` specifies how potential phrases are scored for comparison to the `threshold`
        setting. two settings are available:
        'default': from "Efficient Estimaton of Word Representations in Vector Space" by
            Mikolov, et. al.:
            (count(worda followed by wordb) - min_count) * N /
            (count(worda) * count(wordb)) > threshold`, where `N` is the total vocabulary size.
        'npmi': normalized pointwise mutual information, from "Normalized (Pointwise) Mutual
            Information in Colocation Extraction" by Gerlof Bouma:
            ln(prop(worda followed by wordb) / (prop(worda)*prop(wordb))) /
            - ln(prop(worda followed by wordb)
            where prop(n) is the count of n / the count of everything in the entire corpus
        'npmi' is more robust when dealing with common words that form part of common bigrams, and
            ranges from -1 to 1, but is slower to calculate than the default

        `common_terms` is an optionnal list of "stop words" that won't affect frequency count
        of expressions containing them.
