"""
Automatically detect common phrases (multiword expressions) from a stream of sentences.

The phrases are collocations (frequently co-occurring tokens). See [1]_ for the
exact formula.

For example, if your input stream (=an iterable, with each value a list of token strings) looks like:

>>> print(list(sentence_stream))
[[u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new', u'york', u'was', u'there'],
 [u'machine', u'learning', u'can', u'be', u'useful', u'sometimes'],
 ...,
]

you'd train the detector with:

>>> bigram = Phrases(sentence_stream)

and then transform any sentence (list of token strings) using the standard gensim syntax:

>>> sent = [u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new', u'york', u'was', u'there']
>>> print(bigram[sent])
[u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new_york', u'was', u'there']

(note `new_york` became a single token). As usual, you can also transform an entire
sentence stream using:

>>> print(list(bigram[any_sentence_stream]))
[[u'the', u'mayor', u'of', u'new_york', u'was', u'there'],
 [u'machine_learning', u'can', u'be', u'useful', u'sometimes'],
 ...,
]

You can also continue updating the collocation counts with new sentences, by:

>>> bigram.add_vocab(new_sentence_stream)

These **phrase streams are meant to be used during text preprocessing, before
converting the resulting tokens into vectors using `Dictionary`**. See the
:mod:`gensim.models.word2vec` module for an example application of using phrase detection.

The detection can also be **run repeatedly**, to get phrases longer than
two tokens (e.g. `new_york_times`):

>>> trigram = Phrases(bigram[sentence_stream])
>>> sent = [u'the', u'new', u'york', u'times', u'is', u'a', u'newspaper']
>>> print(trigram[bigram[sent]])
[u'the', u'new_york_times', u'is', u'a', u'newspaper']

        Initialize the model from an iterable of `sentences`. Each sentence must be
        a list of words (unicode strings) that will be used for training.

        The `sentences` iterable can be simply a list, but for larger corpora,
        consider a generator that streams the sentences directly from disk/network,
        without storing everything in RAM. See :class:`BrownCorpus`,
        :class:`Text8Corpus` or :class:`LineSentence` in the :mod:`gensim.models.word2vec`
        module for such examples.

        `min_count` ignore all words and bigrams with total collected count lower
        than this.

        `threshold` represents a threshold for forming the phrases (higher means
        fewer phrases). A phrase of words `a` and `b` is accepted if
        `(cnt(a, b) - min_count) * N / (cnt(a) * cnt(b)) > threshold`, where `N` is the
        total vocabulary size.

        `max_vocab_size` is the maximum size of the vocabulary. Used to control
        pruning of less common words, to keep memory under control. The default
        of 40M needs about 3.6GB of RAM; increase/decrease `max_vocab_size` depending
        on how much available memory you have.

        `delimiter` is the glue character used to join collocation tokens, and
