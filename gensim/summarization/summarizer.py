"""This module provides functions for summarizing texts. Summarizing is based on
ranks of text sentences using a variation of the TextRank algorithm [1]_.

Data
----

.. data:: INPUT_MIN_LENGTH - Minimal number of sentences in text
.. data:: WEIGHT_THRESHOLD - Minimal weight of edge between graph nodes. Smaller weights set to zero.

Example
-------

>>> text = '''Rice Pudding - Poem by Alan Alexander Milne

... She's crying with all her might and main,
... And she won't eat her dinner - rice pudding again -

... I've promised her dolls and a daisy-chain,
... And a book about animals - all in vain -
... What is the matter with Mary Jane?
... What is the matter with Mary Jane?
... She's perfectly well, and she hasn't a pain;
... But, look at her, now she's beginning again! -
... What is the matter with Mary Jane?
... What is the matter with Mary Jane?
... I've promised her sweets and a ride in the train,
... And I've begged her to stop for a bit and explain -

... She's perfectly well and she hasn't a pain,
