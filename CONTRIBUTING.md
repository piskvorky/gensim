Please see [contribution-guide.org](http://www.contribution-guide.org/) for steps we expect from contributors before submitting an issue or bug report. Be as concrete as possible, include relevant logs, package versions etc.

**The proper place for open-ended questions is the [gensim mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gensim).** Github is not the right place for research discussions or feature requests.

For developers: see our [Developer Page](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/wiki/Developer-page#code-style) for details on code style, testing and similar.

Thanks!
