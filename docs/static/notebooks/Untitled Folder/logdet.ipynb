      "$$p(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol\\mu, \\boldsymbol\\Sigma)=(2\\pi)^{-n/2}\\text{det}(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol\\mu)^{T}\\boldsymbol\\Sigma^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol\\mu)\\right)$$\n",
      "$\\boldsymbol\\mu$ being the mean vector and $\\boldsymbol\\Sigma$ being the covariance matrix, arise in numerous occassions involving large datasets. Computing <i>log-likelihood</i> in these requires computation of the log-determinant of the covariance matrix\n",
      "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol\\mu,\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)=-\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi)-\\frac{1}{2}\\log(\\text{det}(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma))-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol\\mu)^{T}\\boldsymbol\\Sigma^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol\\mu)$$\n",
      "The covariance matrix and its inverse are symmetric positive definite (spd) and are often sparse, e.g. due to conditional independence properties of Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF). Therefore they can be stored efficiently even for large dimension $n$.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The usual technique for computing the log-determinant term in the likelihood expression relies on <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_factorization\">Cholesky factorization</a></i> of the matrix, i.e. $\\boldsymbol\\Sigma=\\mathbf{LL}^{T}$, ($\\mathbf{L}$ is the lower triangular Cholesky factor) and then using the diagonal entries of the factor to compute $\\log(\\text{det}(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma))=2\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\log(\\mathbf{L}_{ii})$. However, for sparse matrices, as covariance matrices usually are, the Cholesky factors often suffer from <i>fill-in</i> phenomena - they turn out to be not so sparse themselves. Therefore, for large dimensions this technique becomes infeasible because of a massive memory requirement for storing all these irrelevant non-diagonal co-efficients of the factor. While ordering techniques have been developed to permute the rows and columns beforehand in order to reduce fill-in, e.g. <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_degree_algorithm\">approximate minimum degree</a></i> (AMD) reordering, these techniques depend largely on the sparsity pattern and therefore not guaranteed to give better result.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Recent research shows that using a number of techniques from complex analysis, numerical linear algebra and greedy graph coloring, we can, however, approximate the log-determinant up to an arbitrary precision [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11222-012-9368-y\">Aune et. al., 2012</a>]. The main trick lies within the observation that we can write $\\log(\\text{det}(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma))$ as $\\text{trace}(\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma))$, where $\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)$ is the matrix-logarithm. Computing the log-determinant then requires extracting the trace of the matrix-logarithm as\n",
      "$$\\text{trace}(\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma))=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\mathbf{e}^{T}_{j}\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{e}_{j}$$\n",
      "where each $\\mathbf{e}_{j}$ is a unit basis vector having a 1 in its $j^{\\text{th}}$ position while rest are zeros and we assume that we can compute $\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{e}_{j}$ (explained later). For large dimension $n$, this approach is still costly, so one needs to rely on sampling the trace. For example, using stochastic vectors we can obtain a <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method\">Monte Carlo estimator</a></i> for the trace -\n",
      "$$\\text{trace}(\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma))=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{v}}(\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{v})\\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\mathbf{s}^{T}_{j}\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{s}_{j}$$\n",
      "where the source vectors ($\\mathbf{s}_{j}$) have zero mean and unit variance (e.g. $\\mathbf{s}_{j}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}), \\forall j\\in[1\\cdots k]$). But since this is a Monte Carlo method, we need many many samples to get sufficiently accurate approximation. However, by a method suggested in Aune et. al., we can reduce the number of samples required drastically by using <i>probing-vectors</i> that are obtained from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring\">coloring of the adjacency graph</a> represented by the power of the sparse-matrix, $\\boldsymbol\\Sigma^{p}$, i.e. we can obtain -\n",
      "$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{v}}(\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{v})\\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\mathbf{w}^{T}_{j}\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{w}_{j}$$\n",
      "with $m\\ll n$, where $m$ is the number of colors used in the graph coloring. For a particular color $j$, the probing vector $\\mathbb{w}_{j}$ is obtained by filling with $+1$ or $-1$ uniformly randomly for entries corresponding to nodes of the graph colored with $j$, keeping the rest of the entries as zeros. Since the matrix is sparse, the number of colors used is usually very small compared to the dimension $n$, promising the advantage of this approach.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are two main issues in this technique. First, computing $\\boldsymbol\\Sigma^{p}$ is computationally costly, but experiments show that directly applying a <i>d-distance</i> coloring algorithm on the sparse matrix itself also results in a pretty good approximation. Second, computing the exact matrix-logarithm is often infeasible because its is not guaranteed to be sparse. Aune et. al. suggested that we can rely on rational approximation of the matrix-logarithm times vector using an approach described in <a href=\"http://eprints.ma.man.ac.uk/1136/01/covered/MIMS_ep2007_103.pdf\">Hale et. al [2008]</a>, i.e. writing $\\log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{w}_{j}$ in our desired expression using <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy's_integral_formula\">Cauchy's integral formula</a></i> as -\n",
      "$$log(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)\\mathbf{w}_{j}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_{\\Gamma}log(z)(z\\mathbf{I}-\\boldsymbol\\Sigma)^{-1}\\mathbf{w}_{j}dz\\approx \\frac{-8K(\\lambda_{m}\\lambda_{M})^{\\frac{1}{4}}}{k\\pi N} \\boldsymbol\\Sigma\\Im\\left(-\\sum_{l=1}^{N}\\alpha_{l}(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma-\\sigma_{l}\\mathbf{I})^{-1}\\mathbf{w}_{j}\\right)$$\n",
      "$K$, $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$,  $\\alpha_{l}$, $\\sigma_{l} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are coming from <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_elliptic_functions\">Jacobi elliptic functions</a></i>, $\\lambda_{m}$ and $\\lambda_{M}$ are the minimum/maximum eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol\\Sigma$ (they have to be real-positive), respectively, $N$ is the number of contour points in the quadrature rule of the above integral and  $\\Im(\\mathbf{x})$ represents the imaginary part of $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The problem then finally boils down to solving the shifted family of linear systems $(\\boldsymbol\\Sigma-\\sigma_{l}\\mathbf{I})\\mathbb{x}_{j}=\\mathbb{w}_{j}$. Since $\\boldsymbol\\Sigma$ is sparse, matrix-vector product is not much costly and therefore these systems can be solved with a low memory-requirement using <i>Krylov subspace iterative solvers</i> like <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method\">Conjugate Gradient</a></i> (CG). Since the shifted matrices have complex entries along their diagonal, the appropriate method to choose is <i>Conjugate Orthogonal Conjugate Gradient</i> (COCG) [<a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=106415&tag=1\">H.A. van der Vorst et. al., 1990.</a>]. Alternatively, these systems can be solved at once using <i>CG-M</i> [<a href\"http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/9612014\">Jegerlehner, 1996.</a>] solver which solves for $(\\mathbf{A}+\\sigma\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ for all values of $\\sigma$ using as many matrix-vector products in the CG-iterations as required to solve for one single shifted system. This algorithm shows reliable convergance behavior for systems with reasonable condition number.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One interesting property of this approach is that once the graph coloring information and shifts/weights are known, all the computation components - solving linear systems, computing final vector-vector product - are independently computable. Therefore, computation can be speeded up using parallel computation of these. To use this, a computation framework for Shogun is developed and the whole log-det computation works on top of it.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>An example of using this approach in Shogun</h2>\n",
      "<p>We demonstrate the usage of this technique to estimate log-determinant of a real-valued spd sparse matrix with dimension $715,176\\times 715,176$ with $4,817,870$ non-zero entries, <a href=\"http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/GHS_psdef/apache2.html\">apache2</a>, which is obtained from the <a href=\"http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/\">The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection</a>. Cholesky factorization with AMD for this sparse-matrix gives rise to factors with $353,843,716$ non-zero entries (from source). We use CG-M solver to solve the shifted systems which is then used with <a href=\"http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CSerialComputationEngine.html\">SerialComputationEngine</a> to perform the computation jobs sequentially on a single core, that works even on a normal Desktop machine. Since the original matrix is badly conditioned, here we added a ridge along its diagonal to reduce the condition number so that the CG-M solver converges within reasonable time. Please note that for high condition number, the number of iteration has to be set very high."
