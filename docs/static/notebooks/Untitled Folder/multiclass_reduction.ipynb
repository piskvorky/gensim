      "* [CECOCRandomDenseEncoder](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CECOCRandomDenseEncoder.html): This encoder generate random dense ($+1$/$-1$) codebooks and choose the one with the largest *minimum mutual distance* among the classes. The recommended code length for this encoder is $10\\log K$. \n",
      "* [CECOCRandomSparseEncoder](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CECOCRandomSparseEncoder.html): This is similar to the random dense encoder, except that sparse ($+1$/$-1$/$0$) codebooks are generated. The recommended code length for this encoder is $15\\log K$.\n",
      "* [CECOCOVREncoder](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CECOCOVREncoder.html), [CECOCOVOEncoder](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CECOCOVOEncoder.html): These two encoders mimic the One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One strategies respectively. They are implemented mainly for demonstrative purpose.  When suitable decoders are used, the results will be equivalent to the corresponding strategies, respectively."
