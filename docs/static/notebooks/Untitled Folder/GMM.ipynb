Consider an unobserved (or latent) discrete random variable taking $k$ states $s$ with probabilities $\\text{Pr}(s=i)=\\pi_i$ for $1\\leq i \\leq k$, and $k$ random variables $x_i|s_i$ with arbritary densities or distributions, which are  *conditionally independent* of each other given the state of $s$.

      " <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm\">Expectation Maximisation (EM)</a> is a powerful method to learn any form of latent models and can be applied to the Gaussian mixture model case. Standard methods such as Maximum Likelihood are not straightforward for latent models in general, while EM can almost always be applied. However, it might converge to local optima and does not guarantee globally optimal solutions (this can be dealt with with some tricks as we will see later). While the general idea in EM stays the same for all models it can be used on, the individual steps depend on the particular model that is being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea in EM is to maximise a lower bound, typically called the *free energy*, on the log-likelihood of the model. It does so by repeatedly performing two steps\n",
      "\n",
      " * The E-step optimises the free energy with respect to the latent variables $s_i$, holding the parameters $\\theta$ fixed. This is done via setting the distribution over $s$ to the posterior given the used observations.\n",
      " * The M-step optimises the free energy with respect to the paramters $\\theta$, holding the distribution over the $s_i$ fixed. This is done via maximum likelihood.\n",
      " \n",
      "It can be shown that this procedure never decreases the likelihood and that stationary points (i.e. neither E-step nor M-step produce changes) of it corresponds to local maxima in the model's likelihood. See references for more details on the procedure, and how to obtain a lower bound on the log-likelihood. There exist many different flavours of EM, including variants where only subsets of the model are iterated over at a time. There is no learning rate such as step size or similar, which is good and bad since convergence can be slow."
