Distributed Computing
===================================

Why distributed computing?
---------------------------

Need to build semantic representation of a corpus that is millions of documents large and it's
taking forever? Have several idle machines at your disposal that you could use?
`Distributed computing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing>`_ tries
to accelerate computations by splitting a given task into several smaller subtasks,
passing them on to several computing nodes in parallel.

In the context of `gensim`, computing nodes are computers identified by their IP address/port,
and communication happens over TCP/IP. The whole collection of available machines is called
a *cluster*. The distribution is very coarse grained (not
much communication going on), so the network is allowed to be of relatively high latency.

.. warning::
  The primary reason for using distributed computing is making things run faster. In `gensim`,
  most of the time consuming stuff is done inside low-level routines for linear algebra, inside
  NumPy, independent of any `gensim` code.
  **Installing a fast** `BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms>`_ **library
  for NumPy can improve performance up to 15 times!** So before you start buying those extra computers,
  consider installing a fast, threaded BLAS that is optimized for your particular machine
  (as opposed to a generic, binary-distributed library).
  Options include your vendor's BLAS library (Intel's MKL,
  AMD's ACML, OS X's vecLib, Sun's Sunperf, ...) or some open-source alternative (GotoBLAS, ALTAS).

  To see what BLAS and LAPACK you are using, type into your shell::

    python -c 'import scipy; scipy.show_config()'

Prerequisites
-----------------

For communication between nodes, `gensim` uses `Pyro (PYthon Remote Objects)
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro4>`_, version >= 4.27. This is a library for low-level socket communication
and remote procedure calls (RPC) in Python. `Pyro` is a pure-Python library, so its
installation is quite painless and only involves copying its `*.py` files somewhere onto your Python's import path::

  sudo easy_install Pyro4

You don't have to install `Pyro` to run `gensim`, but if you don't, you won't be able
to access the distributed features (i.e., everything will always run in serial mode,
the examples on this page don't apply).


Core concepts
-----------------------------------

As always, `gensim` strives for a clear and straightforward API (see :ref:`design`).
To this end, *you do not need to make any changes in your code at all* in order to
run it over a cluster of computers!

What you need to do is run a :term:`worker` script (see below) on each of your cluster nodes prior
to starting your computation. Running this script tells `gensim` that it may use the node
as a slave to delegate some work to it. During initialization, the algorithms
inside `gensim` will try to look for and enslave all available worker nodes.

.. glossary::

  Node
    A logical working unit. Can correspond to a single physical machine, but you
    can also run multiple workers on one machine, resulting in multiple
    logical nodes.

  Cluster
    Several nodes which communicate over TCP/IP. Currently, network broadcasting
    is used to discover and connect all communicating nodes, so the nodes must lie
    within the same `broadcast domain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_domain>`_.

  Worker
    A process which is created on each node. To remove a node from your cluster,
    simply kill its worker process.

  Dispatcher
    The dispatcher will be in charge of negotiating all computations, queueing and
    distributing ("dispatching") individual jobs to the workers. Computations never
    "talk" to worker nodes directly, only through this dispatcher. Unlike workers,
    there can only be one active dispatcher at a time in the cluster.
