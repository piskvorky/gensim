Documentation
=============

This section contains gensim tutorials and howto guides.
The **tutorials** are learning-oriented: they are lessons that introduce gensim functionality to new users.
The **guides** are goal-oriented: they demonstrate how to solve a specific problem using gensim.

We always welcome contributions to our documentation via GitHub pull requests, whether it's fixing a typo or authoring an entirely new tutorial or guide.
If you're thinking about contributing documentation, please see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_020_howtos_run_030_doc.py`.
