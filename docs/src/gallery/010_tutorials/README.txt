Congratulations, you have finished the tutorials -- now you know how gensim works :-)
To delve into more details, you can browse through the :ref:`apiref`,
see the :ref:`wiki` or perhaps check out :ref:`distributed` in `gensim`.

Gensim is a fairly mature package that has been used successfully by many individuals and companies, both for rapid prototyping and in production.
That doesn't mean it's perfect though:

* there are parts that could be implemented more efficiently (in C, for example), or make better use of parallelism (multiple machines cores)
* new algorithms are published all the time; help gensim keep up by `discussing them <http://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_ and `contributing code <https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/wiki/Developer-page>`_
* your **feedback is most welcome** and appreciated (and it's not just the code!):
  `idea contributions <https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/wiki/Ideas-&-Features-proposals>`_,
  `bug reports <https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/issues>`_ or just consider contributing
  `user stories and general questions <http://groups.google.com/group/gensim/topics>`_.

Gensim has no ambition to become an all-encompassing framework, across all NLP (or even Machine Learning) subfields.
Its mission is to help NLP practitioners try out popular topic modelling algorithms
on large datasets easily, and to facilitate prototyping of new algorithms for researchers.
