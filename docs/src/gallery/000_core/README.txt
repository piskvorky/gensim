Core Tutorials
--------------

This gallery contains tutorials that introduce `gensim` functionality to a new user.
If you haven't already done so, we strongly recommend you start with the :ref:`intro`.
Each tutorial is stand-alone, but if you're new, we recommend you go through the following in order:

1. :ref:`intro_tutorial`
2. :ref:`tut1`
3. :ref:`tut2`
4. :ref:`tut3`
