How to Compare LDA Models
=========================

Demonstrates how you can compare a topic model with itself or other models.


.. code-block:: default


    # sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 2
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)







First, clean up the 20 Newsgroups dataset. We will use it to fit LDA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------



.. code-block:: default



    from string import punctuation
    from nltk import RegexpTokenizer
    from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups


    newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups()
    eng_stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english'))

    tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'\s+', gaps=True)
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    translate_tab = {ord(p): u" " for p in punctuation}

    def text2tokens(raw_text):
        """Convert a raw text to a list of stemmed tokens."""
        clean_text = raw_text.lower().translate(translate_tab)
        tokens = [token.strip() for token in tokenizer.tokenize(clean_text)]
        tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in eng_stopwords]
        stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
        return [token for token in stemmed_tokens if len(token) > 2]  # skip short tokens

    dataset = [text2tokens(txt) for txt in newsgroups['data']]  # convert a documents to list of tokens

    from gensim.corpora import Dictionary
    dictionary = Dictionary(documents=dataset, prune_at=None)
    dictionary.filter_extremes(no_below=5, no_above=0.3, keep_n=None)  # use Dictionary to remove un-relevant tokens
    dictionary.compactify()

    d2b_dataset = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in dataset]  # convert list of tokens to bag of word representation







Second, fit two LDA models.
---------------------------



.. code-block:: default


    from gensim.models import LdaMulticore
    num_topics = 15

    lda_fst = LdaMulticore(
        corpus=d2b_dataset, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary,
        workers=4, eval_every=None, passes=10, batch=True
    )

    lda_snd = LdaMulticore(
        corpus=d2b_dataset, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary,
        workers=4, eval_every=None, passes=20, batch=True
    )







Time to visualize, yay!
-----------------------

We use two slightly different visualization methods depending on how you're running this tutorial.
If you're running via a Jupyter notebook, then you'll get a nice interactive Plotly heatmap.
If you're viewing the static version of the page, you'll get a similar matplotlib heatmap, but it won't be interactive.



.. code-block:: default



    def plot_difference_plotly(mdiff, title="", annotation=None):
        """Plot the difference between models.

        Uses plotly as the backend."""
        import plotly.graph_objs as go
        import plotly.offline as py

        annotation_html = None
        if annotation is not None:
            annotation_html = [
                [
                    "+++ {}<br>--- {}".format(", ".join(int_tokens), ", ".join(diff_tokens))
                    for (int_tokens, diff_tokens) in row
                ]
                for row in annotation
            ]

        data = go.Heatmap(z=mdiff, colorscale='RdBu', text=annotation_html)
        layout = go.Layout(width=950, height=950, title=title, xaxis=dict(title="topic"), yaxis=dict(title="topic"))
        py.iplot(dict(data=[data], layout=layout))


    def plot_difference_matplotlib(mdiff, title="", annotation=None):
        """Helper function to plot difference between models.

        Uses matplotlib as the backend."""
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18, 14))
        data = ax.imshow(mdiff, cmap='RdBu_r', origin='lower')
        plt.title(title)
        plt.colorbar(data)


    try:
        get_ipython()
        import plotly.offline as py
    except Exception:
        #
        # Fall back to matplotlib if we're not in a notebook, or if plotly is
        # unavailable for whatever reason.
        #
        plot_difference = plot_difference_matplotlib
    else:
        py.init_notebook_mode()
        plot_difference = plot_difference_plotly







Gensim can help you visualise the differences between topics. For this purpose, you can use the ``diff()`` method of LdaModel.

``diff()`` returns a matrix with distances **mdiff** and a matrix with annotations **annotation**. Read the docstring for more detailed info.

In each **mdiff[i][j]** cell you'll find a distance between **topic_i** from the first model and **topic_j** from the second model.

In each **annotation[i][j]** cell you'll find **[tokens from intersection, tokens from difference** between **topic_i** from first model and **topic_j** from the second model.

    Calculate the difference in topic distributions between two models: `self` and `other`.

            Parameters
            ----------
            other : :class:`~gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel`
                The model which will be compared against the current object.
            distance : {'kullback_leibler', 'hellinger', 'jaccard', 'jensen_shannon'}
                The distance metric to calculate the difference with.
            num_words : int, optional
                The number of most relevant words used if `distance == 'jaccard'`. Also used for annotating topics.
            n_ann_terms : int, optional
                Max number of words in intersection/symmetric difference between topics. Used for annotation.
            diagonal : bool, optional
                Whether we need the difference between identical topics (the diagonal of the difference matrix).
            annotation : bool, optional
                Whether the intersection or difference of words between two topics should be returned.
            normed : bool, optional
                Whether the matrix should be normalized or not.

            Returns
            -------
            numpy.ndarray
                A difference matrix. Each element corresponds to the difference between the two topics,
                shape (`self.num_topics`, `other.num_topics`)
            numpy.ndarray, optional
                Annotation matrix where for each pair we include the word from the intersection of the two topics,
                and the word from the symmetric difference of the two topics. Only included if `annotation == True`.
                Shape (`self.num_topics`, `other_model.num_topics`, 2).

            Examples
            --------
            Get the differences between each pair of topics inferred by two models

            .. sourcecode:: pycon

                >>> from gensim.models.ldamulticore import LdaMulticore
                >>> from gensim.test.utils import datapath
                >>>
                >>> m1 = LdaMulticore.load(datapath("lda_3_0_1_model"))
                >>> m2 = LdaMulticore.load(datapath("ldamodel_python_3_5"))
                >>> mdiff, annotation = m1.diff(m2)
                >>> topic_diff = mdiff  # get matrix with difference for each topic pair from `m1` and `m2`

        



Case 1: How topics within ONE model correlate with each other.
--------------------------------------------------------------


Short description:

* x-axis - topic;

* y-axis - topic;

.. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)
   :format: html

* :raw-html-m2r:`<span style="color:red">almost red cell</span>` - strongly decorrelated topics;

.. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)
   :format: html

* :raw-html-m2r:`<span style="color:blue">almost blue cell</span>` - strongly correlated topics.

In an ideal world, we would like to see different topics decorrelated between themselves. In this case, our matrix would look like this:



.. code-block:: default



    import numpy as np

    mdiff = np.ones((num_topics, num_topics))
    np.fill_diagonal(mdiff, 0.)
    plot_difference(mdiff, title="Topic difference (one model) in ideal world")




.. image:: /auto_examples/howtos/images/sphx_glr_run_compare_lda_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Unfortunately, in real life, not everything is so good, and the matrix looks different.


Short description (interactive annotations only):



* ``+++ make, world, well`` - words from the intersection of topics = present in both topics;



* ``--- money, day, still`` - words from the symmetric difference of topics = present in one topic but not the other.



.. code-block:: default



    mdiff, annotation = lda_fst.diff(lda_fst, distance='jaccard', num_words=50)
    plot_difference(mdiff, title="Topic difference (one model) [jaccard distance]", annotation=annotation)




.. image:: /auto_examples/howtos/images/sphx_glr_run_compare_lda_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




If you compare a model with itself, you want to see as many red elements as possible (except diagonal). With this picture, you can look at the not very red elements and understand which topics in the model are very similar and why (you can read annotation if you move your pointer to cell).




Jaccard is stable and robust distance function, but this function not enough sensitive for some purposes. Let's try to use Hellinger distance now.



.. code-block:: default



    mdiff, annotation = lda_fst.diff(lda_fst, distance='hellinger', num_words=50)
    plot_difference(mdiff, title="Topic difference (one model)[hellinger distance]", annotation=annotation)




.. image:: /auto_examples/howtos/images/sphx_glr_run_compare_lda_003.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




You see that everything has become worse, but remember that everything depends on the task.



You need to choose the function with which your personal point of view about topics similarity and your task (from my experience, Jaccard is fine).


Case 2: How topics from DIFFERENT models correlate with each other.
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Sometimes, we want to look at the patterns between two different models and compare them.

You can do this by constructing a matrix with the difference.



.. code-block:: default



    mdiff, annotation = lda_fst.diff(lda_snd, distance='jaccard', num_words=50)
    plot_difference(mdiff, title="Topic difference (two models)[jaccard distance]", annotation=annotation)




.. image:: /auto_examples/howtos/images/sphx_glr_run_compare_lda_004.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Looking at this matrix, you can find similar and different topics (and relevant tokens which describe the intersection and difference).
