# The `Annoy Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah
# <https://github.com/spotify/annoy>`_ library enables similarity queries with
# a Word2Vec model.  The current implementation for finding k nearest neighbors
# in a vector space in gensim has linear complexity via brute force in the
# number of indexed documents, although with extremely low constant factors.
# The retrieved results are exact, which is an overkill in many applications:
# approximate results retrieved in sub-linear time may be enough. Annoy can
# find approximate nearest neighbors much faster.
# 
# Outline
# -------
# 
# 1. Download Text8 Corpus
# 2. Train the Word2Vec model
# 3. Construct AnnoyIndex with model & make a similarity query
# 4. Compare to the traditional indexer
# 5. Persist indices to disk
# 6. Save memory by via memory-mapping indices saved to disk
# 7. Evaluate relationship of ``num_trees`` to initialization time and accuracy
# 8. Work with Google's word2vec C formats
#

# 1. Download Text8 corpus
# ------------------------
import gensim.downloader as api

###############################################################################
# 3. Construct AnnoyIndex with model & make a similarity query
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# An instance of ``AnnoyIndexer`` needs to be created in order to use Annoy in gensim. The ``AnnoyIndexer`` class is located in ``gensim.similarities.index``
# 
# ``AnnoyIndexer()`` takes two parameters:
# 
# * **model**: A ``Word2Vec`` or ``Doc2Vec`` model
# * **num_trees**: A positive integer. ``num_trees`` effects the build
#   time and the index size. **A larger value will give more accurate results,
#   but larger indexes**. More information on what trees in Annoy do can be found
#   `here <https://github.com/spotify/annoy#how-does-it-work>`__. The relationship
#   between ``num_trees``\ , build time, and accuracy will be investigated later
#   in the tutorial. 
# 
# Now that we are ready to make a query, lets find the top 5 most similar words
# to "science" in the Text8 corpus. To make a similarity query we call
# ``Word2Vec.most_similar`` like we would traditionally, but with an added
# parameter, ``indexer``. The only supported indexer in gensim as of now is
# Annoy. 
# 
from gensim.similarities.index import AnnoyIndexer

# 100 trees are being used in this example
annoy_index = AnnoyIndexer(model, 100)
# Derive the vector for the word "science" in our model
vector = model.wv["science"]
# The instance of AnnoyIndexer we just created is passed 
approximate_neighbors = model.wv.most_similar([vector], topn=11, indexer=annoy_index)
# Neatly print the approximate_neighbors and their corresponding cosine similarity values
print("Approximate Neighbors")
for neighbor in approximate_neighbors:
    print(neighbor)

normal_neighbors = model.wv.most_similar([vector], topn=11)
print("\nNormal (not Annoy-indexed) Neighbors")
for neighbor in normal_neighbors:
    print(neighbor)

###############################################################################
# The closer the cosine similarity of a vector is to 1, the more similar that
# word is to our query, which was the vector for "science". There are some
# differences in the ranking of similar words and the set of words included
# within the 10 most similar words.

###############################################################################
# 4. Compare to the traditional indexer
# -------------------------------------

# Set up the model and vector that we are using in the comparison
model.init_sims()
annoy_index = AnnoyIndexer(model, 100)

# Dry run to make sure both indices are fully in RAM
vector = model.wv.vectors_norm[0]

        model.wv.most_similar([rand_vec], topn=5, indexer=annoy_index)
        total_time += time.process_time() - start_time
    return total_time / queries

speed_improvement = gensim_time / annoy_time
print ("\nAnnoy is {0:.2f} times faster on average on this particular run".format(speed_improvement))

###############################################################################
# **This speedup factor is by no means constant** and will vary greatly from
# run to run and is particular to this data set, BLAS setup, Annoy
# parameters(as tree size increases speedup factor decreases), machine
# specifications, among other factors.
# 
# .. Important::
#    Initialization time for the annoy indexer was not included in the times.
#    The optimal knn algorithm for you to use will depend on how many queries
#    you need to make and the size of the corpus. If you are making very few
#    similarity queries, the time taken to initialize the annoy indexer will be
#    longer than the time it would take the brute force method to retrieve
#    results. If you are making many queries however, the time it takes to
#    initialize the annoy indexer will be made up for by the incredibly fast
#    retrieval times for queries once the indexer has been initialized
# 
# .. Important::
#    Gensim's 'most_similar' method is using numpy operations in the form of
#    dot product whereas Annoy's method isnt. If 'numpy' on your machine is
#    using one of the BLAS libraries like ATLAS or LAPACK, it'll run on
#    multiple cores (only if your machine has multicore support ). Check `SciPy
#    Cookbook
#    <http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/ParallelProgramming.html>`_
#    for more details.
# 

###############################################################################
# 5. Persisting indices to disk
# -----------------------------
# 
# You can save and load your indexes from/to disk to prevent having to
# construct them each time. This will create two files on disk, *fname* and
# *fname.d*. Both files are needed to correctly restore all attributes. Before
# loading an index, you will have to create an empty AnnoyIndexer object.
#

# Persist index to disk

# Load index back
import os.path

    annoy_index2 = AnnoyIndexer()
    annoy_index2.load(fname)
    annoy_index2.model = model

# Results should be identical to above
vector = model.wv["science"]
approximate_neighbors2 = model.wv.most_similar([vector], topn=11, indexer=annoy_index2)
for neighbor in approximate_neighbors2:
    print(neighbor)
    
assert approximate_neighbors == approximate_neighbors2

# Be sure to use the same model at load that was used originally, otherwise you
# will get unexpected behaviors.
# 

###############################################################################
# 6. Save memory via memory-mapping indices saved to disk
# -------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Annoy library has a useful feature that indices can be memory-mapped from
# disk. It saves memory when the same index is used by several processes.
# 
# Below are two snippets of code. First one has a separate index for each
# process. The second snipped shares the index between two processes via
# memory-mapping. The second example uses less total RAM as it is shared.
# 

# Remove verbosity from code below (if logging active)

    logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)

import os

###############################################################################
# Bad example: two processes load the Word2vec model from disk and create there
# own Annoy indices from that model.
#

# From the above, we can see that the initialization time of the annoy indexer
# increases in a linear fashion with num_trees. Initialization time will vary
# from corpus to corpus, in the graph above the lee corpus was used
# 
# Furthermore, in this dataset, the accuracy seems logarithmically related to
# the number of trees. We see an improvement in accuracy with more trees, but
# the relationship is nonlinear.

# 7. Work with Google word2vec files
# ----------------------------------
# 
# Our model can be exported to a word2vec C format. There is a binary and a
# plain text word2vec format. Both can be read with a variety of other
# software, or imported back into gensim as a ``KeyedVectors`` object.
# 

# To export our model as text
model.wv.save_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.txt', binary=False)

# View the first 3 lines of the exported file

# The first line has the total number of entries and the vector dimension count. 
# The next lines have a key (a string) followed by its vector.
with open('/tmp/vectors.txt') as myfile:
    for i in range(3):
        print(myfile.readline().strip())

# To import a word2vec text model
wv = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.txt', binary=False)

# To export our model as binary
model.wv.save_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.bin', binary=True)

# To import a word2vec binary model
wv = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.bin', binary=True)

# To create and save Annoy Index from a loaded `KeyedVectors` object (with 100 trees)
annoy_index = AnnoyIndexer(wv, 100)
annoy_index.save('/tmp/mymodel.index')

# Load and test the saved word vectors and saved annoy index
wv = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/tmp/vectors.bin', binary=True)
annoy_index = AnnoyIndexer()
annoy_index.load('/tmp/mymodel.index')
annoy_index.model = wv

vector = wv["cat"]
approximate_neighbors = wv.most_similar([vector], topn=11, indexer=annoy_index)
# Neatly print the approximate_neighbors and their corresponding cosine similarity values
print("Approximate Neighbors")
for neighbor in approximate_neighbors:
    print(neighbor)

normal_neighbors = wv.most_similar([vector], topn=11)
print("\nNormal (not Annoy-indexed) Neighbors")
for neighbor in normal_neighbors:
    print(neighbor)
