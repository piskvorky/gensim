Doc2Vec Model
=============

Introduces Gensim's Doc2Vec model and demonstrates its use on the Lee Corpus.

.. code-block:: default


    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)







Doc2Vec is an NLP tool for representing documents as a vector and is a
generalizing of the Word2Vec method.  This tutorial will serve as an
introduction to Doc2Vec and present ways to train and assess a Doc2Vec model.

This tutorial will take you through the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the training and test corpora (see :ref:`core_concepts_corpus`)
2. Train a Doc2Vec :ref:`core_concepts_model` model using the training corpus
3. Demonstrate how the trained model can be used to infer a :ref:`core_concepts_vector`
4. Assess the model
5. Test the model on the test corpus

Getting Started
---------------

To get going, we'll need to have a set of documents to train our doc2vec
model. In theory, a document could be anything from a short 140 character
tweet, a single paragraph (i.e., journal article abstract), a news article,
or a book. In NLP parlance a collection or set of documents is often referred
to as a **corpus**. 

For this tutorial, we'll be training our model using the `Lee Background
Corpus
<https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/28910/1/hdl_28910.pdf>`_
included in gensim. This corpus contains 314 documents selected from the
Australian Broadcasting Corporationâ€™s news mail service, which provides text
e-mails of headline stories and covers a number of broad topics.

And we'll test our model by eye using the much shorter `Lee Corpus
<https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/28910/1/hdl_28910.pdf>`_
which contains 50 documents.



.. code-block:: default


    import os
    import gensim
    # Set file names for train and test data
    test_data_dir = '{}'.format(os.sep).join([gensim.__path__[0], 'test', 'test_data'])
    lee_train_file = test_data_dir + os.sep + 'lee_background.cor'
    lee_test_file = test_data_dir + os.sep + 'lee.cor'







Define a Function to Read and Preprocess Text
---------------------------------------------

Below, we define a function to open the train/test file (with latin
encoding), read the file line-by-line, pre-process each line using a simple
gensim pre-processing tool (i.e., tokenize text into individual words, remove
punctuation, set to lowercase, etc), and return a list of words. Note that,
for a given file (aka corpus), each continuous line constitutes a single
document and the length of each line (i.e., document) can vary. Also, to
train the model, we'll need to associate a tag/number with each document of
the training corpus. In our case, the tag is simply the zero-based line
number.



.. code-block:: default

    import smart_open

    def read_corpus(fname, tokens_only=False):
        with smart_open.open(fname, encoding="iso-8859-1") as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f):
                if tokens_only:
                    yield gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line)
                else:
                    # For training data, add tags
                    yield gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line), [i])

    train_corpus = list(read_corpus(lee_train_file))
    test_corpus = list(read_corpus(lee_test_file, tokens_only=True))







Let's take a look at the training corpus

And the testing corpus looks like this:



.. code-block:: default

    print(test_corpus[:2])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

Notice that the testing corpus is just a list of lists and does not contain
any tags.


Training the Model
------------------

Now, we'll instantiate a Doc2Vec model with a vector size with 50 words and
iterating over the training corpus 40 times. We set the minimum word count to
2 in order to discard words with very few occurrences. (Without a variety of
representative examples, retaining such infrequent words can often make a
model worse!) Typical iteration counts in published 'Paragraph Vectors'
results, using 10s-of-thousands to millions of docs, are 10-20. More
iterations take more time and eventually reach a point of diminishing
returns.

However, this is a very very small dataset (300 documents) with shortish
documents (a few hundred words). Adding training passes can sometimes help
with such small datasets.



.. code-block:: default

    model = gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec(vector_size=50, min_count=2, epochs=40)







Build a vocabulary


.. code-block:: default

    model.build_vocab(train_corpus)







Essentially, the vocabulary is a dictionary (accessible via
``model.wv.vocab``\ ) of all of the unique words extracted from the training
corpus along with the count (e.g., ``model.wv.vocab['penalty'].count`` for
counts for the word ``penalty``\ ).


Next, train the model on the corpus.
If the BLAS library is being used, this should take no more than 3 seconds.
If the BLAS library is not being used, this should take no more than 2
minutes, so use BLAS if you value your time.



.. code-block:: default

    model.train(train_corpus, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=model.epochs)







Now, we can use the trained model to infer a vector for any piece of text
by passing a list of words to the ``model.infer_vector`` function. This
vector can then be compared with other vectors via cosine similarity.



.. code-block:: default

    vector = model.infer_vector(['only', 'you', 'can', 'prevent', 'forest', 'fires'])
    print(vector)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

     -0.09367087  0.02488928]


Note that ``infer_vector()`` does *not* take a string, but rather a list of
string tokens, which should have already been tokenized the same way as the
``words`` property of original training document objects. 

Also note that because the underlying training/inference algorithms are an
iterative approximation problem that makes use of internal randomization,
repeated inferences of the same text will return slightly different vectors.


Assessing Model
---------------

To assess our new model, we'll first infer new vectors for each document of
the training corpus, compare the inferred vectors with the training corpus,
and then returning the rank of the document based on self-similarity.
Basically, we're pretending as if the training corpus is some new unseen data
and then seeing how they compare with the trained model. The expectation is
that we've likely overfit our model (i.e., all of the ranks will be less than
2) and so we should be able to find similar documents very easily.
Additionally, we'll keep track of the second ranks for a comparison of less
similar documents. 



.. code-block:: default

    ranks = []
    second_ranks = []
    for doc_id in range(len(train_corpus)):
        inferred_vector = model.infer_vector(train_corpus[doc_id].words)
        sims = model.docvecs.most_similar([inferred_vector], topn=len(model.docvecs))
        rank = [docid for docid, sim in sims].index(doc_id)
        ranks.append(rank)
    
        second_ranks.append(sims[1])







Let's count how each document ranks with respect to the training corpus 

NB. Results vary between runs due to random seeding and very small corpus


.. code-block:: default

    import collections

    counter = collections.Counter(ranks)
    print(counter)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Counter({0: 291, 1: 9})


Basically, greater than 95% of the inferred documents are found to be most
similar to itself and about 5% of the time it is mistakenly most similar to
another document. the checking of an inferred-vector against a
training-vector is a sort of 'sanity check' as to whether the model is
behaving in a usefully consistent manner, though not a real 'accuracy' value.

This is great and not entirely surprising. We can take a look at an example:



.. code-block:: default

    print('Document ({}): Â«{}Â»\n'.format(doc_id, ' '.join(train_corpus[doc_id].words)))
    print(u'SIMILAR/DISSIMILAR DOCS PER MODEL %s:\n' % model)
    for label, index in [('MOST', 0), ('SECOND-MOST', 1), ('MEDIAN', len(sims)//2), ('LEAST', len(sims) - 1)]:

Notice above that the most similar document (usually the same text) is has a
similarity score approaching 1.0. However, the similarity score for the
second-ranked documents should be significantly lower (assuming the documents
are in fact different) and the reasoning becomes obvious when we examine the
text itself.

Conclusion
----------

Let's review what we've seen in this tutorial:

1. Load and preprocess the training and test corpora (see :ref:`core_concepts_corpus`)
2. Train a Doc2Vec :ref:`core_concepts_model` model using the training corpus
3. Demonstrate how the trained model can be used to infer a :ref:`core_concepts_vector`
4. Assess the model
5. Test the model on the test corpus

That's it! Doc2Vec is a great way to explore relationships between documents.
