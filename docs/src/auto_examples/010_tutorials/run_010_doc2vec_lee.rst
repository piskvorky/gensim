Doc2Vec Model
=============

Introduces Gensim's Doc2Vec model and demonstrates its use on the Lee Corpus.

.. code-block:: default


    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)







Doc2Vec is a :ref:`core_concepts_model` that represents each
:ref:`core_concepts_document` as a :ref:`core_concepts_vector`.  This
tutorial introduces the model and demonstrates how to train and assess it.

Here's a list of what we'll be doing:

0. Review the relevant models: bag-of-words, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec
1. Load and preprocess the training and test corpora (see :ref:`core_concepts_corpus`)
2. Train a Doc2Vec :ref:`core_concepts_model` model using the training corpus
3. Demonstrate how the trained model can be used to infer a :ref:`core_concepts_vector`
4. Assess the model
5. Test the model on the test corpus

Review: Bag-of-words
--------------------

.. Note:: Feel free to skip these review sections if you're already familiar with the models.

You may be familiar with the `bag-of-words model
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model>`_ from the
:ref:`core_concepts_py` section.
This model transforms each document to a fixed-length vector of integers.
For example, given the sentences:

- ``John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.``
- ``John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football.``

The model outputs the vectors:

- ``[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]``
- ``[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]``

Each vector has 10 elements, where each element counts the number of times a
particular word occurred in the document.
The order of elements is arbitrary.
In the example above, the order of the elements corresponds to the words:
``["John", "likes", "to", "watch", "movies", "Mary", "too", "also", "football", "games", "hates"]``.

Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective, but have several weaknesses.

First, they lose all information about word order: "John likes Mary" and
"Mary likes John" correspond to identical vectors. There is a solution: bag
of `n-grams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram>`__
models consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as
fixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data
sparsity and high dimensionality.

Second, the model does not attempt to learn the meaning of the underlying
words, and as a consequence, the distance between vectors doesn't always
reflect the difference in meaning.  The ``Word2Vec`` model addresses this
second problem.

Review: ``Word2Vec`` Model
--------------------------

``Word2Vec`` is a more recent model that embeds words in a lower-dimensional
vector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of
word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar
meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have
differing meanings. For example, ``strong`` and ``powerful`` would be close
together and ``strong`` and ``Paris`` would be relatively far.

Gensim's :py:class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec` class implements this model.

With the ``Word2Vec`` model, we can calculate the vectors for each **word** in a document.
But what if we want to calculate a vector for the **entire document**\ ?
We could average the vectors for each word in the document - while this is quick and crude, it can often be useful.
However, there is a better way...

Introducing: Paragraph Vector
-----------------------------

.. Important:: In Gensim, we refer to the Paragraph Vector model as ``Doc2Vec``.

Le and Mikolov in 2014 introduced the *Paragraph Vector*, which usually outperforms such simple-averaging of ``Word2Vec`` vectors.

The basic idea is: act as if a document has another floating word-like
vector, which contributes to all training predictions, and is updated like
other word-vectors, but we will call it a doc-vector. Gensim's
:py:class:`~gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec` class implements this algorithm.

There are two implementations:

1. Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)
2. Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)

.. Important::
  Don't let the implementation details below scare you.
  They're advanced material: if it's too much, then move on to the next section.

PV-DM is analogous to Word2Vec CBOW. The doc-vectors are obtained by training
a neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a center word based an
average of both context word-vectors and the full document's doc-vector.

PV-DBOW is analogous to Word2Vec SG. The doc-vectors are obtained by training
a neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a target word just from
the full document's doc-vector. (It is also common to combine this with
skip-gram testing, using both the doc-vector and nearby word-vectors to
predict a single target word, but only one at a time.)

Prepare the Training and Test Data
----------------------------------

For this tutorial, we'll be training our model using the `Lee Background
Corpus
<https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/28910/1/hdl_28910.pdf>`_
included in gensim. This corpus contains 314 documents selected from the
Australian Broadcasting Corporationâ€™s news mail service, which provides text
e-mails of headline stories and covers a number of broad topics.

And we'll test our model by eye using the much shorter `Lee Corpus
<https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/28910/1/hdl_28910.pdf>`_
which contains 50 documents.



.. code-block:: default


    import os
    import gensim
    # Set file names for train and test data
    test_data_dir = '{}'.format(os.sep).join([gensim.__path__[0], 'test', 'test_data'])
    lee_train_file = test_data_dir + os.sep + 'lee_background.cor'
    lee_test_file = test_data_dir + os.sep + 'lee.cor'







Define a Function to Read and Preprocess Text
---------------------------------------------

Below, we define a function to:

- open the train/test file (with latin encoding)
- read the file line-by-line
- pre-process each line (tokenize text into individual words, remove punctuation, set to lowercase, etc)

The file we're reading is a **corpus**.
Each line of the file is a **document**.

.. Important::
  To train the model, we'll need to associate a tag/number with each document
  of the training corpus. In our case, the tag is simply the zero-based line
  number.



.. code-block:: default

    import smart_open

    def read_corpus(fname, tokens_only=False):
        with smart_open.open(fname, encoding="iso-8859-1") as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f):
                if tokens_only:
                    yield gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line)
                else:
                    # For training data, add tags
                    yield gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line), [i])

    train_corpus = list(read_corpus(lee_train_file))
    test_corpus = list(read_corpus(lee_test_file, tokens_only=True))







Let's take a look at the training corpus

And the testing corpus looks like this:



.. code-block:: default

    print(test_corpus[:2])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    [['the', 'national', 'executive', 'of', 'the', 'strife', 'torn', 'democrats', 'last', 'night', 'appointed', 'little', 'known', 'west', 'australian', 'senator', 'brian', 'greig', 'as', 'interim', 'leader', 'shock', 'move', 'likely', 'to', 'provoke', 'further', 'conflict', 'between', 'the', 'party', 'senators', 'and', 'its', 'organisation', 'in', 'move', 'to', 'reassert', 'control', 'over', 'the', 'party', 'seven', 'senators', 'the', 'national', 'executive', 'last', 'night', 'rejected', 'aden', 'ridgeway', 'bid', 'to', 'become', 'interim', 'leader', 'in', 'favour', 'of', 'senator', 'greig', 'supporter', 'of', 'deposed', 'leader', 'natasha', 'stott', 'despoja', 'and', 'an', 'outspoken', 'gay', 'rights', 'activist'], ['cash', 'strapped', 'financial', 'services', 'group', 'amp', 'has', 'shelved', 'million', 'plan', 'to', 'buy', 'shares', 'back', 'from', 'investors', 'and', 'will', 'raise', 'million', 'in', 'fresh', 'capital', 'after', 'profits', 'crashed', 'in', 'the', 'six', 'months', 'to', 'june', 'chief', 'executive', 'paul', 'batchelor', 'said', 'the', 'result', 'was', 'solid', 'in', 'what', 'he', 'described', 'as', 'the', 'worst', 'conditions', 'for', 'stock', 'markets', 'in', 'years', 'amp', 'half', 'year', 'profit', 'sank', 'per', 'cent', 'to', 'million', 'or', 'share', 'as', 'australia', 'largest', 'investor', 'and', 'fund', 'manager', 'failed', 'to', 'hit', 'projected', 'per', 'cent', 'earnings', 'growth', 'targets', 'and', 'was', 'battered', 'by', 'falling', 'returns', 'on', 'share', 'markets']]


Notice that the testing corpus is just a list of lists and does not contain
any tags.


Training the Model
------------------

Now, we'll instantiate a Doc2Vec model with a vector size with 50 words and
iterating over the training corpus 40 times. We set the minimum word count to
2 in order to discard words with very few occurrences. (Without a variety of
representative examples, retaining such infrequent words can often make a
model worse!) Typical iteration counts in published 'Paragraph Vectors'
results, using 10s-of-thousands to millions of docs, are 10-20. More
iterations take more time and eventually reach a point of diminishing
returns.

However, this is a very very small dataset (300 documents) with shortish
documents (a few hundred words). Adding training passes can sometimes help
with such small datasets.



.. code-block:: default

    model = gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec(vector_size=50, min_count=2, epochs=40)







Build a vocabulary


.. code-block:: default

    model.build_vocab(train_corpus)







Essentially, the vocabulary is a dictionary (accessible via
``model.wv.vocab``\ ) of all of the unique words extracted from the training
corpus along with the count (e.g., ``model.wv.vocab['penalty'].count`` for
counts for the word ``penalty``\ ).


Next, train the model on the corpus.
If the BLAS library is being used, this should take no more than 3 seconds.
If the BLAS library is not being used, this should take no more than 2
minutes, so use BLAS if you value your time.



.. code-block:: default

    model.train(train_corpus, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=model.epochs)







Now, we can use the trained model to infer a vector for any piece of text
by passing a list of words to the ``model.infer_vector`` function. This
vector can then be compared with other vectors via cosine similarity.



.. code-block:: default

    vector = model.infer_vector(['only', 'you', 'can', 'prevent', 'forest', 'fires'])
    print(vector)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

      0.04623495  0.09869438]


Note that ``infer_vector()`` does *not* take a string, but rather a list of
string tokens, which should have already been tokenized the same way as the
``words`` property of original training document objects.

Also note that because the underlying training/inference algorithms are an
iterative approximation problem that makes use of internal randomization,
repeated inferences of the same text will return slightly different vectors.


Assessing the Model
-------------------

To assess our new model, we'll first infer new vectors for each document of
the training corpus, compare the inferred vectors with the training corpus,
and then returning the rank of the document based on self-similarity.
Basically, we're pretending as if the training corpus is some new unseen data
and then seeing how they compare with the trained model. The expectation is
that we've likely overfit our model (i.e., all of the ranks will be less than
2) and so we should be able to find similar documents very easily.
Additionally, we'll keep track of the second ranks for a comparison of less
similar documents.



.. code-block:: default

    ranks = []
    second_ranks = []
    for doc_id in range(len(train_corpus)):
        inferred_vector = model.infer_vector(train_corpus[doc_id].words)
        sims = model.docvecs.most_similar([inferred_vector], topn=len(model.docvecs))
        rank = [docid for docid, sim in sims].index(doc_id)
        ranks.append(rank)

        second_ranks.append(sims[1])







Let's count how each document ranks with respect to the training corpus

NB. Results vary between runs due to random seeding and very small corpus


.. code-block:: default

    import collections

    counter = collections.Counter(ranks)
    print(counter)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Counter({0: 291, 1: 9})


Basically, greater than 95% of the inferred documents are found to be most
similar to itself and about 5% of the time it is mistakenly most similar to
another document. Checking the inferred-vector against a
training-vector is a sort of 'sanity check' as to whether the model is
behaving in a usefully consistent manner, though not a real 'accuracy' value.

This is great and not entirely surprising. We can take a look at an example:



.. code-block:: default

    print('Document ({}): Â«{}Â»\n'.format(doc_id, ' '.join(train_corpus[doc_id].words)))
    print(u'SIMILAR/DISSIMILAR DOCS PER MODEL %s:\n' % model)
    for label, index in [('MOST', 0), ('SECOND-MOST', 1), ('MEDIAN', len(sims)//2), ('LEAST', len(sims) - 1)]:
        print(u'%s %s: Â«%sÂ»\n' % (label, sims[index], ' '.join(train_corpus[sims[index][0]].words)))

Notice above that the most similar document (usually the same text) is has a
similarity score approaching 1.0. However, the similarity score for the
second-ranked documents should be significantly lower (assuming the documents
are in fact different) and the reasoning becomes obvious when we examine the
text itself.

We can run the next cell repeatedly to see a sampling other target-document
comparisons.

    Train Document (108): Â«the international monetary fund imf has described economic conditions in australia as reasonably robust in the release of its latest world economic outlook the imf says prospects globally remain subject to considerable uncertainty but number of factors should help support recovery in including the stimulus still in the pipeline from policy decisions by central banks and governments around the world sharp weakening in oil prices should also contribute the imf says growth in australia is expected to reach per cent in stronger than this year but half percentage point lower than projected in its october outlook australia exports while sustained so far by weak currency could come under pressure if global growth and commodity prices remain weakÂ»

    Similar Document (136, 0.7728472352027893): Â«new report suggests the costs of an aging australian population have been exaggerated the report issued by the australia institute says detailed examination of population and health data shows an aging population will not create an unsustainable burden on shrinking workforce far from being an economic and social burden it found the majority of older people enjoyed healthy and independent lives many making financial contributions to their families and participating in voluntary community activities the paper challenges the assumption an older population will see health costs rise to unsustainable levels it says rising health costs are caused mainly by factors other than aging such as the growth of medical technology rising consumer demand and escalating pricesÂ»


Testing the Model
-----------------

Using the same approach above, we'll infer the vector for a randomly chosen
test document, and compare the document to our model by eye.



.. code-block:: default


    # Pick a random document from the test corpus and infer a vector from the model
    doc_id = random.randint(0, len(test_corpus) - 1)
    inferred_vector = model.infer_vector(test_corpus[doc_id])
    sims = model.docvecs.most_similar([inferred_vector], topn=len(model.docvecs))

    # Compare and print the most/median/least similar documents from the train corpus
    print('Test Document ({}): Â«{}Â»\n'.format(doc_id, ' '.join(test_corpus[doc_id])))
    print(u'SIMILAR/DISSIMILAR DOCS PER MODEL %s:\n' % model)
    for label, index in [('MOST', 0), ('MEDIAN', len(sims)//2), ('LEAST', len(sims) - 1)]:
        print(u'%s %s: Â«%sÂ»\n' % (label, sims[index], ' '.join(train_corpus[sims[index][0]].words)))

Conclusion
----------

Let's review what we've seen in this tutorial:

0. Review the relevant models: bag-of-words, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec
1. Load and preprocess the training and test corpora (see :ref:`core_concepts_corpus`)
2. Train a Doc2Vec :ref:`core_concepts_model` model using the training corpus
3. Demonstrate how the trained model can be used to infer a :ref:`core_concepts_vector`
4. Assess the model
5. Test the model on the test corpus

That's it! Doc2Vec is a great way to explore relationships between documents.
