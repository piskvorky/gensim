A common reason for such a\ncharade is that we want to determine **similarity between pairs of\ndocuments**, or the **similarity between a specific document and a set of\nother documents** (such as a user query vs. indexed documents).\n\nTo show how this can be done in gensim, let us consider the same corpus as in the\nprevious examples (which really originally comes from Deerwester et al.'s\n`\"Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis\" <http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/IDA/lsa_ind.pdf>`_\nseminal 1990 article).\nTo follow Deerwester's example, we first use this tiny corpus to define a 2-dimensional\nLSI space:\n\n"
