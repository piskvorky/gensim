# In this tutorial, I will show how to transform documents from one vector representation
# into another. This process serves two goals:
#
# 1. To bring out hidden structure in the corpus, discover relationships between
#    words and use them to describe the documents in a new and
#    (hopefully) more semantic way.
# 2. To make the document representation more compact. This both improves efficiency
#    (new representation consumes less resources) and efficacy (marginal data
#    trends are ignored, noise-reduction).
#
# Creating the Corpus
# -------------------
#
# First, we need to create a corpus to work with.
# This step is the same as in the previous tutorial;
# if you completed it, feel free to skip to the next section.

    "Human machine interface for lab abc computer applications",

#
# Creating a transformation
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# The transformations are standard Python objects, typically initialized by means of
# a :dfn:`training corpus`:
#
from gensim import models

tfidf = models.TfidfModel(corpus)  # step 1 -- initialize a model

###############################################################################
# We used our old corpus from tutorial 1 to initialize (train) the transformation model. Different
# transformations may require different initialization parameters; in case of TfIdf, the
# "training" consists simply of going through the supplied corpus once and computing document frequencies
# of all its features. Training other models, such as Latent Semantic Analysis or Latent Dirichlet
# Allocation, is much more involved and, consequently, takes much more time.
#
# .. note::
#   Transformations always convert between two specific vector
#   spaces. The same vector space (= the same set of feature ids) must be used for training
#   as well as for subsequent vector transformations. Failure to use the same input
#   feature space, such as applying a different string preprocessing, using different
#   feature ids, or using bag-of-words input vectors where TfIdf vectors are expected, will
#   result in feature mismatch during transformation calls and consequently in either
#   garbage output and/or runtime exceptions.
#
#
# Transforming vectors
# +++++++++++++++++++++
#
# From now on, ``tfidf`` is treated as a read-only object that can be used to convert
# any vector from the old representation (bag-of-words integer counts) to the new representation
# (TfIdf real-valued weights):

doc_bow = [(0, 1), (1, 1)]
print(tfidf[doc_bow])  # step 2 -- use the model to transform vectors

###############################################################################
# Or to apply a transformation to a whole corpus:

corpus_tfidf = tfidf[corpus]
for doc in corpus_tfidf:
    print(doc)

###############################################################################
# In this particular case, we are transforming the same corpus that we used
# for training, but this is only incidental. Once the transformation model has been initialized,
# it can be used on any vectors (provided they come from the same vector space, of course),
# even if they were not used in the training corpus at all. This is achieved by a process called
# folding-in for LSA, by topic inference for LDA etc.
#
# .. note::
#   Calling ``model[corpus]`` only creates a wrapper around the old ``corpus``
#   document stream -- actual conversions are done on-the-fly, during document iteration.
#   We cannot convert the entire corpus at the time of calling ``corpus_transformed = model[corpus]``,
#   because that would mean storing the result in main memory, and that contradicts gensim's objective of memory-indepedence.
#   If you will be iterating over the transformed ``corpus_transformed`` multiple times, and the
#   transformation is costly, :ref:`serialize the resulting corpus to disk first <corpus-formats>` and continue
#   using that.
#
# Transformations can also be serialized, one on top of another, in a sort of chain:

lsi_model = models.LsiModel(corpus_tfidf, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=2)  # initialize an LSI transformation
corpus_lsi = lsi_model[corpus_tfidf]  # create a double wrapper over the original corpus: bow->tfidf->fold-in-lsi

###############################################################################
# Here we transformed our Tf-Idf corpus via `Latent Semantic Indexing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing>`_
# into a latent 2-D space (2-D because we set ``num_topics=2``). Now you're probably wondering: what do these two latent
# dimensions stand for? Let's inspect with :func:`models.LsiModel.print_topics`:

lsi_model.print_topics(2)

###############################################################################
# (the topics are printed to log -- see the note at the top of this page about activating
# logging)
#
# It appears that according to LSI, "trees", "graph" and "minors" are all related
# words (and contribute the most to the direction of the first topic), while the
# second topic practically concerns itself with all the other words. As expected,
# the first five documents are more strongly related to the second topic while the
# remaining four documents to the first topic:

# both bow->tfidf and tfidf->lsi transformations are actually executed here, on the fly
for doc, as_text in zip(corpus_lsi, documents):
    print(doc, as_text)

###############################################################################
# Model persistency is achieved with the :func:`save` and :func:`load` functions:
import os
import tempfile

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(prefix='model-', suffix='.lsi', delete=False) as tmp:
    lsi_model.save(tmp.name)  # same for tfidf, lda, ...

loaded_lsi_model = models.LsiModel.load(tmp.name)

os.unlink(tmp.name)

###############################################################################
# The next question might be: just how exactly similar are those documents to each other?
# Is there a way to formalize the similarity, so that for a given input document, we can
# order some other set of documents according to their similarity? Similarity queries
# are covered in the next tutorial (:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_core_run_similarity_queries.py`).
#
# .. _transformations:
#
# Available transformations
# --------------------------
#
# Gensim implements several popular Vector Space Model algorithms:
#
# * `Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency, Tf-Idf <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf>`_
#   expects a bag-of-words (integer values) training corpus during initialization.
#   During transformation, it will take a vector and return another vector of the
#   same dimensionality, except that features which were rare in the training corpus
#   will have their value increased.
#   It therefore converts integer-valued vectors into real-valued ones, while leaving
#   the number of dimensions intact. It can also optionally normalize the resulting
#   vectors to (Euclidean) unit length.
#
#  .. sourcecode:: pycon
#
#     model = models.TfidfModel(corpus, normalize=True)
#
# * `Latent Semantic Indexing, LSI (or sometimes LSA) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing>`_
#   transforms documents from either bag-of-words or (preferrably) TfIdf-weighted space into
#   a latent space of a lower dimensionality. For the toy corpus above we used only
#   2 latent dimensions, but on real corpora, target dimensionality of 200--500 is recommended
#   as a "golden standard" [1]_.
#
#   .. sourcecode:: pycon
#
#     model = models.LsiModel(tfidf_corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=300)
#
#   LSI training is unique in that we can continue "training" at any point, simply
#   by providing more training documents. This is done by incremental updates to
#   the underlying model, in a process called `online training`. Because of this feature, the
#   input document stream may even be infinite -- just keep feeding LSI new documents
#   as they arrive, while using the computed transformation model as read-only in the meanwhile!
#
#   .. sourcecode:: pycon
#
#     model.add_documents(another_tfidf_corpus)  # now LSI has been trained on tfidf_corpus + another_tfidf_corpus
#     lsi_vec = model[tfidf_vec]  # convert some new document into the LSI space, without affecting the model
#
#     model.add_documents(more_documents)  # tfidf_corpus + another_tfidf_corpus + more_documents
#     lsi_vec = model[tfidf_vec]
#
#   See the :mod:`gensim.models.lsimodel` documentation for details on how to make
#   LSI gradually "forget" old observations in infinite streams. If you want to get dirty,
#   there are also parameters you can tweak that affect speed vs. memory footprint vs. numerical
#   precision of the LSI algorithm.
#
#   `gensim` uses a novel online incremental streamed distributed training algorithm (quite a mouthful!),
#   which I published in [5]_. `gensim` also executes a stochastic multi-pass algorithm
#   from Halko et al. [4]_ internally, to accelerate in-core part
#   of the computations.
#   See also :ref:`wiki` for further speed-ups by distributing the computation across
#   a cluster of computers.
#
# * `Random Projections, RP <http://www.cis.hut.fi/ella/publications/randproj_kdd.pdf>`_ aim to
#   reduce vector space dimensionality. This is a very efficient (both memory- and
#   CPU-friendly) approach to approximating TfIdf distances between documents, by throwing in a little randomness.
#   Recommended target dimensionality is again in the hundreds/thousands, depending on your dataset.
#
#   .. sourcecode:: pycon
#
#     model = models.RpModel(tfidf_corpus, num_topics=500)
#
# * `Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation>`_
#   is yet another transformation from bag-of-words counts into a topic space of lower
#   dimensionality. LDA is a probabilistic extension of LSA (also called multinomial PCA),
#   so LDA's topics can be interpreted as probability distributions over words. These distributions are,
#   just like with LSA, inferred automatically from a training corpus. Documents
#   are in turn interpreted as a (soft) mixture of these topics (again, just like with LSA).
#
#   .. sourcecode:: pycon
#
#     model = models.LdaModel(corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=100)
#
#   `gensim` uses a fast implementation of online LDA parameter estimation based on [2]_,
#   modified to run in :ref:`distributed mode <distributed>` on a cluster of computers.
#
# * `Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, HDP <http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v15/wang11a/wang11a.pdf>`_
#   is a non-parametric bayesian method (note the missing number of requested topics):
#
#   .. sourcecode:: pycon
#
#     model = models.HdpModel(corpus, id2word=dictionary)
#
#   `gensim` uses a fast, online implementation based on [3]_.
#   The HDP model is a new addition to `gensim`, and still rough around its academic edges -- use with care.
#
# Adding new :abbr:`VSM (Vector Space Model)` transformations (such as different weighting schemes) is rather trivial;
# see the :ref:`apiref` or directly the `Python code <https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/tfidfmodel.py>`_
# for more info and examples.
#
# It is worth repeating that these are all unique, **incremental** implementations,
# which do not require the whole training corpus to be present in main memory all at once.
# With memory taken care of, I am now improving :ref:`distributed`,
# to improve CPU efficiency, too.
# If you feel you could contribute by testing, providing use-cases or code, see the `Gensim Developer guide <https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Developer-page>`__.
