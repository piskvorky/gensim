Important::\n  The above example loads the entire corpus into memory.\n  In practice, corpora may be very large, so loading them into memory may be impossible.\n  Gensim intelligently handles such corpora by *streaming* them one document at a time.\n  See `corpus_streaming_tutorial` for details.\n\nThis is a particularly small example of a corpus for illustration purposes.\nAnother example could be a list of all the plays written by Shakespeare, list\nof all wikipedia articles, or all tweets by a particular person of interest.\n\nAfter collecting our corpus, there are typically a number of preprocessing\nsteps we want to undertake. We'll keep it simple and just remove some\ncommonly used English words (such as 'the') and words that occur only once in\nthe corpus. In the process of doing so, we'll tokenize our data.\nTokenization breaks up the documents into words (in this case using space as\na delimiter).\n\n..

        "\nVector\n------\n\nTo infer the latent structure in our corpus we need a way to represent\ndocuments that we can manipulate mathematically. One approach is to represent\neach document as a vector of *features*.\nFor example, a single feature may be thought of as a question-answer pair:\n\n1. How many times does the word *splonge* appear in the document? Zero.\n2. How many paragraphs does the document consist of? Two.\n3. How many fonts does the document use? Five.\n\nThe question is usually represented only by its integer id (such as `1`, `2` and `3`).\nThe representation of this document then becomes a series of pairs like ``(1, 0.0), (2, 2.0), (3, 5.0)``.\nThis is known as a *dense vector*, because it contains an explicit answer to each of the above questions.\n\nIf we know all the questions in advance, we may leave them implicit\nand simply represent the document as ``(0, 2, 5)``.\nThis sequence of answers is the **vector** for our document (in this case a 3-dimensional dense vector).\nFor practical purposes, only questions to which the answer is (or\ncan be converted to) a *single floating point number* are allowed in Gensim.\n\nIn practice, vectors often consist of many zero values.\nTo save memory, Gensim omits all vector elements with value 0.0.\nThe above example thus becomes ``(2, 2.0), (3, 5.0)``.\nThis is known as a *sparse vector* or *bag-of-words vector*.\nThe values of all missing features in this sparse representation can be unambiguously resolved to zero, ``0.0``.\n\nAssuming the questions are the same, we can compare the vectors of two different documents to each other.\nFor example, assume we are given two vectors ``(0.0, 2.0, 5.0)`` and ``(0.1, 1.9, 4.9)``.\nBecause the vectors are very similar to each other, we can conclude that the documents corresponding to those vectors are similar, too.\nOf course, the correctness of that conclusion depends on how well we picked the questions in the first place.\n\nAnother approach to represent a document as a vector is the *bag-of-words\nmodel*.\nUnder the bag-of-words model each document is represented by a vector\ncontaining the frequency counts of each word in the dictionary.\nFor example, assume we have a dictionary containing the words\n``['coffee', 'milk', 'sugar', 'spoon']``.\nA document consisting of the string ``\"coffee milk coffee\"`` would then\nbe represented by the vector ``[2, 1, 0, 0]`` where the entries of the vector\nare (in order) the occurrences of \"coffee\", \"milk\", \"sugar\" and \"spoon\" in\nthe document. The length of the vector is the number of entries in the\ndictionary. One of the main properties of the bag-of-words model is that it\ncompletely ignores the order of the tokens in the document that is encoded,\nwhich is where the name bag-of-words comes from.\n\nOur processed corpus has 12 unique words in it, which means that each\ndocument will be represented by a 12-dimensional vector under the\nbag-of-words model. We can use the dictionary to turn tokenized documents\ninto these 12-dimensional vectors. We can see what these IDs correspond to:\n\n\n"

        "Note that while this list lives entirely in memory, in most applications you\nwill want a more scalable solution. Luckily, ``gensim`` allows you to use any\niterator that returns a single document vector at a time. See the\ndocumentation for more details.\n\n.. Important::\n  The distinction between a document and a vector is that the former is text,\n  and the latter is a mathematically convenient representation of the text.\n  Sometimes, people will use the terms interchangeably: for example, given\n  some arbitrary document ``D``, instead of saying \"the vector that\n  corresponds to document ``D``\", they will just say \"the vector ``D``\" or\n  the \"document ``D``\".  This achieves brevity at the cost of ambiguity.\n\n  As long as you remember that documents exist in document space, and that\n  vectors exist in vector space, the above ambiguity is acceptable.\n\n.. Important::\n  Depending on how the representation was obtained, two different documents\n  may have the same vector representations.\n\n\nModel\n-----\n\nNow that we have vectorized our corpus we can begin to transform it using\n*models*. We use model as an abstract term referring to a *transformation* from\none document representation to another. In ``gensim`` documents are\nrepresented as vectors so a model can be thought of as a transformation\nbetween two vector spaces. The model learns the details of this\ntransformation during training, when it reads the training\n`core_concepts_corpus`.\n\nOne simple example of a model is `tf-idf\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf>`_.  The tf-idf model\ntransforms vectors from the bag-of-words representation to a vector space\nwhere the frequency counts are weighted according to the relative rarity of\neach word in the corpus.\n\nHere's a simple example. Let's initialize the tf-idf model, training it on\nour corpus and transforming the string \"system minors\":\n\n\n"
