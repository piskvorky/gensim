This is a tiny corpus of nine documents, each consisting of only a single sentence.

First, let's tokenize the documents, remove common words (using a toy stoplist)
as well as words that only appear once in the corpus:

Your way of processing the documents will likely vary; here, I only split on whitespace
to tokenize, followed by lowercasing each word. In fact, I use this particular
(simplistic and inefficient) setup to mimic the experiment done in Deerwester et al.'s
original LSA article [1]_.

The ways to process documents are so varied and application- and language-dependent that I
decided to *not* constrain them by any interface. Instead, a document is represented
by the features extracted from it, not by its "surface" string form: how you get to
the features is up to you. Below I describe one common, general-purpose approach (called
:dfn:`bag-of-words`), but keep in mind that different application domains call for
different features, and, as always, it's `garbage in, garbage out <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_In,_Garbage_Out>`_...

To convert documents to vectors, we'll use a document representation called
`bag-of-words <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words>`_. In this representation,
each document is represented by one vector where each vector element represents
a question-answer pair, in the style of:

- Question: How many times does the word `system` appear in the document?
- Answer: Once.

It is advantageous to represent the questions only by their (integer) ids. The mapping
between the questions and ids is called a dictionary:

Here we assigned a unique integer id to all words appearing in the corpus with the
:class:`gensim.corpora.dictionary.Dictionary` class. This sweeps across the texts, collecting word counts
and relevant statistics. In the end, we see there are twelve distinct words in the
processed corpus, which means each document will be represented by twelve numbers (ie., by a 12-D vector).
To see the mapping between words and their ids:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-104

To actually convert tokenized documents to vectors:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-109

.. code-block:: default


    new_doc = "Human computer interaction"
    new_vec = dictionary.doc2bow(new_doc.lower().split())

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-115

The function :func:`doc2bow` simply counts the number of occurrences of
each distinct word, converts the word to its integer word id
and returns the result as a sparse vector. The sparse vector ``[(0, 1), (1, 1)]``
therefore reads: in the document `"Human computer interaction"`, the words `computer`
(id 0) and `human` (id 1) appear once; the other ten dictionary words appear (implicitly) zero times.

By now it should be clear that the vector feature with ``id=10`` stands for the question "How many
times does the word `graph` appear in the document?" and that the answer is "zero" for
the first six documents and "one" for the remaining three.

.. _corpus_streaming_tutorial:

Corpus Streaming -- One Document at a Time
-------------------------------------------

Note that `corpus` above resides fully in memory, as a plain Python list.
In this simple example, it doesn't matter much, but just to make things clear,
let's assume there are millions of documents in the corpus. Storing all of them in RAM won't do.
Instead, let's assume the documents are stored in a file on disk, one document per line. Gensim
only requires that a corpus must be able to return one document vector at a time:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-145

.. code-block:: default

    from smart_open import open  # for transparently opening remote files


    class MyCorpus:
        def __iter__(self):
            for line in open('https://radimrehurek.com/mycorpus.txt'):
                # assume there's one document per line, tokens separated by whitespace
                yield dictionary.doc2bow(line.lower().split())








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 146-150

The full power of Gensim comes from the fact that a corpus doesn't have to be
a ``list``, or a ``NumPy`` array, or a ``Pandas`` dataframe, or whatever.
Gensim *accepts any object that, when iterated over, successively yields
documents*.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 150-156

.. code-block:: default


    # This flexibility allows you to create your own corpus classes that stream the
    # documents directly from disk, network, database, dataframes... The models
    # in Gensim are implemented such that they don't require all vectors to reside
    # in RAM at once. You can even create the documents on the fly!








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-163

Download the sample `mycorpus.txt file here <https://radimrehurek.com/mycorpus.txt>`_. The assumption that
each document occupies one line in a single file is not important; you can mold
the `__iter__` function to fit your input format, whatever it is.
Walking directories, parsing XML, accessing the network...
Just parse your input to retrieve a clean list of tokens in each document,
then convert the tokens via a dictionary to their ids and yield the resulting sparse vector inside `__iter__`.

Corpus is now an object. We didn't define any way to print it, so `print` just outputs address
of the object in memory. Not very useful. To see the constituent vectors, let's
iterate over the corpus and print each document vector (one at a time):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 171-175

.. code-block:: default


    for vector in corpus_memory_friendly:  # load one vector into memory at a time
        print(vector)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)]
    [(0, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)]
    [(2, 1), (5, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)]
    [(1, 1), (5, 2), (8, 1)]
    [(3, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)]
    [(9, 1)]
    [(9, 1), (10, 1)]
    [(9, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1)]
    [(4, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1)]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 176-181

Although the output is the same as for the plain Python list, the corpus is now much
more memory friendly, because at most one vector resides in RAM at a time. Your
corpus can now be as large as you want.

Similarly, to construct the dictionary without loading all texts into memory:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 181-195

.. code-block:: default


    # collect statistics about all tokens
    dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(line.lower().split() for line in open('https://radimrehurek.com/mycorpus.txt'))
    # remove stop words and words that appear only once
    stop_ids = [
        dictionary.token2id[stopword]
        for stopword in stoplist
        if stopword in dictionary.token2id
    ]
    once_ids = [tokenid for tokenid, docfreq in dictionary.dfs.items() if docfreq == 1]
    dictionary.filter_tokens(stop_ids + once_ids)  # remove stop words and words that appear only once
    dictionary.compactify()  # remove gaps in id sequence after words that were removed
    print(dictionary)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 196-219

And that is all there is to it! At least as far as bag-of-words representation is concerned.
Of course, what we do with such a corpus is another question; it is not at all clear
how counting the frequency of distinct words could be useful. As it turns out, it isn't, and
we will need to apply a transformation on this simple representation first, before
we can use it to compute any meaningful document vs. document similarities.
Transformations are covered in the next tutorial
(:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_core_run_topics_and_transformations.py`),
but before that, let's briefly turn our attention to *corpus persistency*.

.. _corpus-formats:

Corpus Formats
---------------

There exist several file formats for serializing a Vector Space corpus (~sequence of vectors) to disk.
`Gensim` implements them via the *streaming corpus interface* mentioned earlier:
documents are read from (resp. stored to) disk in a lazy fashion, one document at
a time, without the whole corpus being read into main memory at once.

One of the more notable file formats is the `Market Matrix format <http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html>`_.
To save a corpus in the Matrix Market format:

create a toy corpus of 2 documents, as a plain Python list

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 219-223

.. code-block:: default

    corpus = [[(1, 0.5)], []]  # make one document empty, for the heck of it

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    MmCorpus(2 documents, 2 features, 1 non-zero entries)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 244-245

Instead, to view the contents of a corpus:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 245-249

.. code-block:: default

or

    [(1, 0.5)]
    []




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 257-261

The second way is obviously more memory-friendly, but for testing and development
purposes, nothing beats the simplicity of calling ``list(corpus)``.

To save the same Matrix Market document stream in Blei's LDA-C format,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 261-264

In this way, `gensim` can also be used as a memory-efficient **I/O format conversion tool**:
just load a document stream using one format and immediately save it in another format.
Adding new formats is dead easy, check out the `code for the SVMlight corpus
<https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/corpora/svmlightcorpus.py>`_ for an example.
