Set up a small corpus consisting of documents belonging to one of two topics\n2. Train an LDA model to distinguish between the two topics\n3. Use the model to obtain distributions for some sample words\n4. Compare the distributions to each other using a variety of distance metrics: Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, Jaccard\n5. Discuss the concept of distance metrics in slightly more detail\n\nThe scope for adding new similarity metrics is large, as there exist an even\nlarger suite of metrics and methods to add to the matutils.py file.\nFor more details, see `Similarity Measures for Text Document Clustering\n<http://www.academia.edu/download/32952068/pg049_Similarity_Measures_for_Text_Document_Clustering.pdf>`_\nby A. Huang.\n\n"
