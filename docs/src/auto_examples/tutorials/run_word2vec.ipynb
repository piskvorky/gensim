        "In case you missed the buzz, Word2Vec is a widely used algorithm based on neural\nnetworks, commonly referred to as \"deep learning\" (though word2vec itself is rather shallow).\nUsing large amounts of unannotated plain text, word2vec learns relationships\nbetween words automatically. The output are vectors, one vector per word,\nwith remarkable linear relationships that allow us to do things like:\n\n* vec(\"king\") - vec(\"man\") + vec(\"woman\") =~ vec(\"queen\")\n* vec(\"Montreal Canadiens\") \u2013 vec(\"Montreal\") + vec(\"Toronto\") =~ vec(\"Toronto Maple Leafs\").\n\nWord2vec is very useful in `automatic text tagging\n<https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/movie-plots-by-genre>`_\\ , recommender\nsystems and machine translation.\n\nThis tutorial:\n\n#. Introduces ``Word2Vec`` as an improvement over traditional bag-of-words\n#. Shows off a demo of ``Word2Vec`` using a pre-trained model\n#. Demonstrates training a new model from your own data\n#. Demonstrates loading and saving models\n#. Introduces several training parameters and demonstrates their effect\n#. Discusses memory requirements\n#. Visualizes Word2Vec embeddings by applying dimensionality reduction\n\nReview: Bag-of-words\n--------------------\n\n.. Note:: Feel free to skip these review sections if you're already familiar with the models.\n\nYou may be familiar with the `bag-of-words model\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model>`_ from the\n`core_concepts_vector` section.\nThis model transforms each document to a fixed-length vector of integers.\nFor example, given the sentences:\n\n- ``John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.``\n- ``John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football.``\n\nThe model outputs the vectors:\n\n- ``[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]``\n- ``[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]``\n\nEach vector has 10 elements, where each element counts the number of times a\nparticular word occurred in the document.\nThe order of elements is arbitrary.\nIn the example above, the order of the elements corresponds to the words:\n``[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\", \"hates\"]``.\n\nBag-of-words models are surprisingly effective, but have several weaknesses.\n\nFirst, they lose all information about word order: \"John likes Mary\" and\n\"Mary likes John\" correspond to identical vectors. There is a solution: bag\nof `n-grams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram>`__\nmodels consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as\nfixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data\nsparsity and high dimensionality.\n\nSecond, the model does not attempt to learn the meaning of the underlying\nwords, and as a consequence, the distance between vectors doesn't always\nreflect the difference in meaning.  The ``Word2Vec`` model addresses this\nsecond problem.\n\nIntroducing: the ``Word2Vec`` Model\n-----------------------------------\n\n``Word2Vec`` is a more recent model that embeds words in a lower-dimensional\nvector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of\nword-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar\nmeanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have\ndiffering meanings. For example, ``strong`` and ``powerful`` would be close\ntogether and ``strong`` and ``Paris`` would be relatively far.\n\nThe are two versions of this model and :py:class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec`\nclass implements them both:\n\n1. Skip-grams (SG)\n2. Continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW)\n\n.. Important::\n  Don't let the implementation details below scare you.\n  They're advanced material: if it's too much, then move on to the next section.\n\nThe `Word2Vec Skip-gram <http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model>`__\nmodel, for example, takes in pairs (word1, word2) generated by moving a\nwindow across text data, and trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on\nthe synthetic task of given an input word, giving us a predicted probability\ndistribution of nearby words to the input. A virtual `one-hot\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot>`__ encoding of words\ngoes through a 'projection layer' to the hidden layer; these projection\nweights are later interpreted as the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer\nhas 300 neurons, this network will give us 300-dimensional word embeddings.\n\nContinuous-bag-of-words Word2vec is very similar to the skip-gram model. It\nis also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. The synthetic training task now uses\nthe average of multiple input context words, rather than a single word as in\nskip-gram, to predict the center word. Again, the projection weights that\nturn one-hot words into averageable vectors, of the same width as the hidden\nlayer, are interpreted as the word embeddings.\n\n\n"
