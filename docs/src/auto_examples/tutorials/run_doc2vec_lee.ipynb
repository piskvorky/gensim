        "Doc2Vec is a `core_concepts_model` that represents each\n`core_concepts_document` as a `core_concepts_vector`.  This\ntutorial introduces the model and demonstrates how to train and assess it.\n\nHere's a list of what we'll be doing:\n\n0. Review the relevant models: bag-of-words, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec\n1. Load and preprocess the training and test corpora (see `core_concepts_corpus`)\n2. Train a Doc2Vec `core_concepts_model` model using the training corpus\n3. Demonstrate how the trained model can be used to infer a `core_concepts_vector`\n4. Assess the model\n5. Test the model on the test corpus\n\nReview: Bag-of-words\n--------------------\n\n.. Note:: Feel free to skip these review sections if you're already familiar with the models.\n\nYou may be familiar with the `bag-of-words model\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model>`_ from the\n`core_concepts_vector` section.\nThis model transforms each document to a fixed-length vector of integers.\nFor example, given the sentences:\n\n- ``John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.``\n- ``John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football.``\n\nThe model outputs the vectors:\n\n- ``[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]``\n- ``[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]``\n\nEach vector has 10 elements, where each element counts the number of times a\nparticular word occurred in the document.\nThe order of elements is arbitrary.\nIn the example above, the order of the elements corresponds to the words:\n``[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\", \"hates\"]``.\n\nBag-of-words models are surprisingly effective, but have several weaknesses.\n\nFirst, they lose all information about word order: \"John likes Mary\" and\n\"Mary likes John\" correspond to identical vectors. There is a solution: bag\nof `n-grams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram>`__\nmodels consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as\nfixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data\nsparsity and high dimensionality.\n\nSecond, the model does not attempt to learn the meaning of the underlying\nwords, and as a consequence, the distance between vectors doesn't always\nreflect the difference in meaning.  The ``Word2Vec`` model addresses this\nsecond problem.\n\nReview: ``Word2Vec`` Model\n--------------------------\n\n``Word2Vec`` is a more recent model that embeds words in a lower-dimensional\nvector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of\nword-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar\nmeanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have\ndiffering meanings. For example, ``strong`` and ``powerful`` would be close\ntogether and ``strong`` and ``Paris`` would be relatively far.\n\nGensim's :py:class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec` class implements this model.\n\nWith the ``Word2Vec`` model, we can calculate the vectors for each **word** in a document.\nBut what if we want to calculate a vector for the **entire document**\\ ?\nWe could average the vectors for each word in the document - while this is quick and crude, it can often be useful.\nHowever, there is a better way...\n\nIntroducing: Paragraph Vector\n-----------------------------\n\n.. Important:: In Gensim, we refer to the Paragraph Vector model as ``Doc2Vec``.\n\nLe and Mikolov in 2014 introduced the `Doc2Vec algorithm <https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf>`__, which usually outperforms such simple-averaging of ``Word2Vec`` vectors.\n\nThe basic idea is: act as if a document has another floating word-like\nvector, which contributes to all training predictions, and is updated like\nother word-vectors, but we will call it a doc-vector. Gensim's\n:py:class:`~gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec` class implements this algorithm.\n\nThere are two implementations:\n\n1. Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)\n2. Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)\n\n.. Important::\n  Don't let the implementation details below scare you.\n  They're advanced material: if it's too much, then move on to the next section.\n\nPV-DM is analogous to Word2Vec CBOW. The doc-vectors are obtained by training\na neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a center word based an\naverage of both context word-vectors and the full document's doc-vector.\n\nPV-DBOW is analogous to Word2Vec SG. The doc-vectors are obtained by training\na neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a target word just from\nthe full document's doc-vector. (It is also common to combine this with\nskip-gram testing, using both the doc-vector and nearby word-vectors to\npredict a single target word, but only one at a time.)\n\nPrepare the Training and Test Data\n----------------------------------\n\nFor this tutorial, we'll be training our model using the `Lee Background\nCorpus\n<https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/28910/1/hdl_28910.pdf>`_\nincluded in gensim. This corpus contains 314 documents selected from the\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s news mail service, which provides text\ne-mails of headline stories and covers a number of broad topics.\n\nAnd we'll test our model by eye using the much shorter `Lee Corpus\n<https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/28910/1/hdl_28910.pdf>`_\nwhich contains 50 documents.\n\n\n"
