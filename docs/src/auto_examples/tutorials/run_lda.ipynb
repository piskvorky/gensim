        "The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to train and tune an LDA model.\n\nIn this tutorial we will:\n\n* Load input data.\n* Pre-process that data.\n* Transform documents into bag-of-words vectors.\n* Train an LDA model.\n\nThis tutorial will **not**:\n\n* Explain how Latent Dirichlet Allocation works\n* Explain how the LDA model performs inference\n* Teach you all the parameters and options for Gensim's LDA implementation\n\nIf you are not familiar with the LDA model or how to use it in Gensim, I (Olavur Mortensen)\nsuggest you read up on that before continuing with this tutorial. Basic\nunderstanding of the LDA model should suffice. Examples:\n\n* `Introduction to Latent Dirichlet Allocation <http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation>`_\n* Gensim tutorial: `sphx_glr_auto_examples_core_run_topics_and_transformations.py`\n* Gensim's LDA model API docs: :py:class:`gensim.models.LdaModel`\n\nI would also encourage you to consider each step when applying the model to\nyour data, instead of just blindly applying my solution. The different steps\nwill depend on your data and possibly your goal with the model.\n\n## Data\n\nI have used a corpus of NIPS papers in this tutorial, but if you're following\nthis tutorial just to learn about LDA I encourage you to consider picking a\ncorpus on a subject that you are familiar with. Qualitatively evaluating the\noutput of an LDA model is challenging and can require you to understand the\nsubject matter of your corpus (depending on your goal with the model).\n\nNIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) is a machine learning conference\nso the subject matter should be well suited for most of the target audience\nof this tutorial.  You can download the original data from Sam Roweis'\n`website <http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html>`_.  The code below will\nalso do that for you.\n\n.. Important::\n    The corpus contains 1740 documents, and not particularly long ones.\n    So keep in mind that this tutorial is not geared towards efficiency, and be\n    careful before applying the code to a large dataset.\n\n\n"

        "## Training\n\nWe are ready to train the LDA model. We will first discuss how to set some of\nthe training parameters.\n\nFirst of all, the elephant in the room: how many topics do I need? There is\nreally no easy answer for this, it will depend on both your data and your\napplication. I have used 10 topics here because I wanted to have a few topics\nthat I could interpret and \"label\", and because that turned out to give me\nreasonably good results. You might not need to interpret all your topics, so\nyou could use a large number of topics, for example 100.\n\n``chunksize`` controls how many documents are processed at a time in the\ntraining algorithm. Increasing chunksize will speed up training, at least as\nlong as the chunk of documents easily fit into memory. I've set ``chunksize =\n2000``, which is more than the amount of documents, so I process all the\ndata in one go. Chunksize can however influence the quality of the model, as\ndiscussed in Hoffman and co-authors [2], but the difference was not\nsubstantial in this case.\n\n``passes`` controls how often we train the model on the entire corpus.\nAnother word for passes might be \"epochs\". ``iterations`` is somewhat\ntechnical, but essentially it controls how often we repeat a particular loop\nover each document. It is important to set the number of \"passes\" and\n\"iterations\" high enough.\n\nI suggest the following way to choose iterations and passes. First, enable\nlogging (as described in many Gensim tutorials), and set ``eval_every = 1``\nin ``LdaModel``. When training the model look for a line in the log that\nlooks something like this::\n\n   2016-06-21 15:40:06,753 - gensim.models.ldamodel - DEBUG - 68/1566 documents converged within 400 iterations\n\nIf you set ``passes = 20`` you will see this line 20 times. Make sure that by\nthe final passes, most of the documents have converged. So you want to choose\nboth passes and iterations to be high enough for this to happen.\n\nWe set ``alpha = 'auto'`` and ``eta = 'auto'``. Again this is somewhat\ntechnical, but essentially we are automatically learning two parameters in\nthe model that we usually would have to specify explicitly.\n\n\n"
