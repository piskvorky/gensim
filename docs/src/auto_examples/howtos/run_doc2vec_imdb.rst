How to Reproduce Results of Le and Mikolov 2014
===============================================

Shows how to reproduce results of the Le and Mikolov paper using Gensim.

Introduction
------------

This guide shows you how to reproduce the results of the paper by `Le and
Mikolov 2014 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf>`_ using Gensim. While the
entire paper is worth reading (it's only 9 pages), we will be focusing on
Section 3.2: "Beyond One Sentence - Sentiment Analysis with the IMDB
dataset".

This guide follows the following steps:

#. Load the IMDB dataset
#. Train a variety of Doc2Vec models on the dataset
#. Evaluate the performance of each model using a logistic regression
#. Examine some of the results directly:

When examining results, we will look for answers for the following questions:

#. Are inferred vectors close to the precalculated ones?
#. Do close documents seem more related than distant ones?
#. Do the word vectors show useful similarities?
#. Are the word vectors from this dataset any good at analogies?

Load corpus
-----------

Our data for the tutorial will be the `IMDB archive
<http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/>`_.
If you're not familiar with this dataset, then here's a brief intro: it
contains several thousand movie reviews.

Each review is a single line of text containing multiple sentences, for example:

```
One of the best movie-dramas I have ever seen. We do a lot of acting in the
church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the
good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this one,
especially for those who have an interest in acting, as a "must see."
```

These reviews will be the **documents** that we will work with in this tutorial.
There are 100 thousand reviews in total.

#. 25k reviews for training (12.5k positive, 12.5k negative)
#. 25k reviews for testing (12.5k positive, 12.5k negative)
#. 50k unlabeled reviews

Out of 100k reviews, 50k have a label: either positive (the reviewer liked
the movie) or negative.
The remaining 50k are unlabeled.

Our first task will be to prepare the dataset.

More specifically, we will:

#. Download the tar.gz file (it's only 84MB, so this shouldn't take too long)
#. Unpack it and extract each movie review
#. Split the reviews into training and test datasets

First, let's define a convenient datatype for holding data for a single document:

* words: The text of the document, as a ``list`` of words.
* tags: Used to keep the index of the document in the entire dataset.
* split: one of ``train``\ , ``test`` or ``extra``. Determines how the document will be used (for training, testing, etc).
* sentiment: either 1 (positive), 0 (negative) or None (unlabeled document).

This data type is helpful for later evaluation and reporting.
In particular, the ``index`` member will help us quickly and easily retrieve the vectors for a document from a model.

    SentimentDocument = collections.namedtuple('SentimentDocument', 'words tags split sentiment')







We can now proceed with loading the corpus.


.. code-block:: default

        fname = url.split('/')[-1]

        if os.path.isfile(fname):
           return fname

        # Download the file to local storage first.
        # We can't read it on the fly because of
        # https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open/issues/331
        with smart_open.open(url, "rb", ignore_ext=True) as fin:
            with smart_open.open(fname, 'wb', ignore_ext=True) as fout:
                while True:
                    buf = fin.read(io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)
                    if not buf:
                        break
                    fout.write(buf)

        return fname

    def create_sentiment_document(name, text, index):
        _, split, sentiment_str, _ = name.split('/')
        sentiment = {'pos': 1.0, 'neg': 0.0, 'unsup': None}[sentiment_str]

        if sentiment is None:
            split = 'extra'

        tokens = gensim.utils.to_unicode(text).split()
        return SentimentDocument(tokens, [index], split, sentiment)

    def extract_documents():
        fname = download_dataset()

        index = 0

        with tarfile.open(fname, mode='r:gz') as tar:
            for member in tar.getmembers():
                if re.match(r'aclImdb/(train|test)/(pos|neg|unsup)/\d+_\d+.txt$', member.name):
                    member_bytes = tar.extractfile(member).read()
                    member_text = member_bytes.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
                    assert member_text.count('\n') == 0
                    yield create_sentiment_document(member.name, member_text, index)
                    index += 1

    alldocs = list(extract_documents())







Working with the entire 100k document corpus takes close to 40 minutes.
Let's reduce the size of the dataset so we can run the example more quickly.



.. code-block:: default

    import random

    def shrink_list(the_list, fraction):
        sample_size = int(fraction * len(the_list))
        return random.sample(the_list, sample_size)

    def shrink_dataset(docs, fraction=0.1):
        train = shrink_list([d for d in docs if d.split == 'train'], fraction)
        test = shrink_list([d for d in docs if d.split == 'test'], fraction)
        extra = shrink_list([d for d in docs if d.split == 'extra'], fraction)

        return [
            SentimentDocument(d.words, [i], d.split, d.sentiment)
            for (i, d) in enumerate(train + test + extra)
        ]

    # comment the line below to use the full dataset
    # alldocs = shrink_dataset(alldocs)







Here's what a single document looks like

Set-up Doc2Vec Training & Evaluation Models
-------------------------------------------
We approximate the experiment of Le & Mikolov `"Distributed Representations
of Sentences and Documents"
<http://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf>`_ with guidance from
Mikolov's `example go.sh
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/word2vec-toolkit/Q49FIrNOQRo/J6KG8mUj45sJ>`_::

    ./word2vec -train ../alldata-id.txt -output vectors.txt -cbow 0 -size 100 -window 10 -negative 5 -hs 0 -sample 1e-4 -threads 40 -binary 0 -iter 20 -min-count 1 -sentence-vectors 1

We vary the following parameter choices:

* 100-dimensional vectors, as the 400-d vectors of the paper take a lot of
  memory and, in our tests of this task, don't seem to offer much benefit
* Similarly, frequent word subsampling seems to decrease sentiment-prediction
  accuracy, so it's left out
* ``cbow=0`` means skip-gram which is equivalent to the paper's 'PV-DBOW'
  mode, matched in gensim with ``dm=0``
* Added to that DBOW model are two DM models, one which averages context
  vectors (\ ``dm_mean``\ ) and one which concatenates them (\ ``dm_concat``\ ,
  resulting in a much larger, slower, more data-hungry model)
* A ``min_count=2`` saves quite a bit of model memory, discarding only words
  that appear in a single doc (and are thus no more expressive than the
  unique-to-each doc vectors themselves)

Le and Mikolov note that combining a paragraph vector from Distributed Bag of
Words (DBOW) and Distributed Memory (DM) improves performance. We will
follow, pairing the models together for evaluation. Here, we concatenate the
paragraph vectors obtained from each model with the help of a thin wrapper
class included in a gensim test module. (Note that this a separate, later
concatenation of output-vectors than the kind of input-window-concatenation
enabled by the ``dm_concat=1`` mode above.)

Predictive Evaluation Methods
-----------------------------

Given a document, our ``Doc2Vec`` models output a vector representation of the document.
How useful is a particular model?
In case of sentiment analysis, we want the ouput vector to reflect the sentiment in the input document.
So, in vector space, positive documents should be distant from negative documents.

We train a logistic regression from the training set:

  - regressors (inputs): document vectors from the Doc2Vec model
  - target (outpus): sentiment labels

So, this logistic regression will be able to predict sentiment given a document vector.

Next, we test our logistic regression on the test set, and measure the rate of errors (incorrect predictions).
If the document vectors from the Doc2Vec model reflect the actual sentiment well, the error rate will be low.

Therefore, the error rate of the logistic regression is indication of *how well* the given Doc2Vec model represents documents as vectors.
We can then compare different ``Doc2Vec`` models by looking at their error rates.



.. code-block:: default


    import numpy as np
    import statsmodels.api as sm
    from random import sample

    def logistic_predictor_from_data(train_targets, train_regressors):
        """Fit a statsmodel logistic predictor on supplied data"""
        logit = sm.Logit(train_targets, train_regressors)
        predictor = logit.fit(disp=0)
        # print(predictor.summary())
        return predictor

    def error_rate_for_model(test_model, train_set, test_set):
        """Report error rate on test_doc sentiments, using supplied model and train_docs"""

        train_targets = [doc.sentiment for doc in train_set]
        train_regressors = [test_model.docvecs[doc.tags[0]] for doc in train_set]
        train_regressors = sm.add_constant(train_regressors)
        predictor = logistic_predictor_from_data(train_targets, train_regressors)

        test_regressors = [test_model.docvecs[doc.tags[0]] for doc in test_set]
        test_regressors = sm.add_constant(test_regressors)

        # Predict & evaluate
        test_predictions = predictor.predict(test_regressors)
        corrects = sum(np.rint(test_predictions) == [doc.sentiment for doc in test_set])
        errors = len(test_predictions) - corrects
        error_rate = float(errors) / len(test_predictions)
        return (error_rate, errors, len(test_predictions), predictor)







Bulk Training & Per-Model Evaluation
------------------------------------

Note that doc-vector training is occurring on *all* documents of the dataset,
which includes all TRAIN/TEST/DEV docs.  Because the native document-order
has similar-sentiment documents in large clumps – which is suboptimal for
training – we work with once-shuffled copy of the training set.

We evaluate each model's sentiment predictive power based on error rate, and
the evaluation is done for each model.

(On a 4-core 2.6Ghz Intel Core i7, these 20 passes training and evaluating 3
main models takes about an hour.)

In our testing, contrary to the results of the paper, on this problem,
PV-DBOW alone performs as good as anything else. Concatenating vectors from
different models only sometimes offers a tiny predictive improvement – and
stays generally close to the best-performing solo model included.

The best results achieved here are just around 10% error rate, still a long
way from the paper's reported 7.42% error rate.

(Other trials not shown, with larger vectors and other changes, also don't
come close to the paper's reported value. Others around the net have reported
a similar inability to reproduce the paper's best numbers. The PV-DM/C mode
improves a bit with many more training epochs – but doesn't reach parity with
PV-DBOW.)


Examining Results
-----------------

Let's look for answers to the following questions:

#. Are inferred vectors close to the precalculated ones?
#. Do close documents seem more related than distant ones?
#. Do the word vectors show useful similarities?
#. Are the word vectors from this dataset any good at analogies?

    MEDIAN (48884, -0.020214587450027466): «Tarzan and his mate(1934) was the only Tarzan movie I didn't see when I was a kid. It sounded boring. Now I have seen it. I have seen the ape man(1932) about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive. It's a remarkable movie. It's almost flawless. Tarzan and his mate(1934) however, falters. It's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own. The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great. Big budget expensive. Tarzan himself is co-starring. Jane dominates. She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead. Well. She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. Forever. The thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle. Stupid? Later someone founds it in the river. Well it's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead. Some cheap drama. The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that he is gone. She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to England). Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is, how hard he is to kill. The caravan is leaving and Jane go along. Again a pothole. She could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. She could be smart. She could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. She can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in Liana's. Picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle Jane. She could talk to the apes, and so on. If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable. Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down. And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with "I blame myself as much as you". A punishment for being vane perhaps? Nonsense. Struggle, a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate. Still. This movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep. Just lean back and enjoy. It's Tarzan and Jane for God sake.»

    LEAST (56144, -0.4906221330165863): «Let me say bravo to the cast,crew and director you all should be proud a film I was lucky enough to see at the HMC film fest with a packed theater. Not only did it win awards,it won over the Audience so props to all involved I can't wait till the next one comes out.»


Somewhat, in terms of reviewer tone, movie genre, etc... the MOST
cosine-similar docs usually seem more like the TARGET than the MEDIAN or
LEAST... especially if the MOST has a cosine-similarity > 0.5. Re-run the
cell to try another random target document.


Do the word vectors show useful similarities?

Do the DBOW words look meaningless? That's because the gensim DBOW model
doesn't train word vectors – they remain at their random initialized values –
unless you ask with the ``dbow_words=1`` initialization parameter. Concurrent
word-training slows DBOW mode significantly, and offers little improvement
(and sometimes a little worsening) of the error rate on this IMDB
sentiment-prediction task, but may be appropriate on other tasks, or if you
also need word-vectors.

Words from DM models tend to show meaningfully similar words when there are
many examples in the training data (as with 'plot' or 'actor'). (All DM modes
inherently involve word-vector training concurrent with doc-vector training.)


Are the word vectors from this dataset any good at analogies?

Even though this is a tiny, domain-specific dataset, it shows some meager
capability on the general word analogies – at least for the DM/mean and
DM/concat models which actually train word vectors. (The untrained
random-initialized words of the DBOW model of course fail miserably.)
