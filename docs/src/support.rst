Open source support
-------------------

The main communication channel is the `Gensim mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_.

This is the preferred way to ask for help, report problems and share insights with the community. Newbie questions are perfectly fine, as long as you've read the :ref:`tutorials <sphx_glr_auto_examples>`.

**⚠️ Please don't send me private emails unless you have a substantial budget for commercial support (see below).**

FAQ and some useful snippets of code are maintained on GitHub: https://github.com/RARE-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Recipes-&-FAQ.

We're on `Twitter @gensim_py <https://twitter.com/gensim_py>`_. You can also try asking on StackOverflow, using the `gensim tag <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gensim>`_, but the mailing list above will give you more authoritative answers, faster.


.. _Commercial support:

Commercial support
------------------

I run a consulting R&D company focused on data mining and unstructured text processing, https://rare-technologies.com.

If you need commercial support for Gensim or a corporate training in machine learning, `get in touch <http://rare-technologies.com/contact>`_ for a quote.

We're not interested in any sort of equity arrangements.


For developers
--------------

Developers who want to contribute to Gensim are welcome – Gensim is an open source project.

First propose your feature / fix on the `Gensim mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_ and if there is consensus for accepting your contribution, read the `Developer page <https://github.com/RARE-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Developer-page>`_ and implement it. Thanks!

Note that Github is not a medium for asking open-ended questions. Please use the `Gensim mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_ for that.
