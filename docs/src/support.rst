**‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't send me private emails unless you have a substantial budget for commercial support (see below).**

Open source support
-------------------

The main communication channel is the free `Gensim mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_.

This is the preferred way to ask for help, report problems and share insights with the community. Newbie questions are perfectly fine, as long as you've read the :ref:`tutorials <sphx_glr_auto_examples>` and `FAQ <https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Recipes-&-FAQ>`_.

FAQ and some useful snippets of code are maintained on GitHub: https://github.com/RARE-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Recipes-&-FAQ.

We're on `Twitter @gensim_py <https://twitter.com/gensim_py>`_. You can also try asking on StackOverflow, using the `gensim tag <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gensim>`_, but the mailing list above will give you more authoritative answers, faster.


.. _Commercial support:

Commercial support
------------------

If your company needs commercial support, please consider `becoming a Gensim sponsor <https://github.com/sponsors/piskvorky>`_. How it works: you chip in, we prioritize your tickets.

Corporate sponsorship means sustainability. It allows us to dedicate our time keeping Gensim stable and performant for you.

The Gold Sponsor üëë tier also allows for a commercial non-LGPL license of Gensim.


For developers
--------------

Developers who want to contribute to Gensim are welcome ‚Äì Gensim is an open source project.

First propose your feature / fix on the `Gensim mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_ and if there is consensus for accepting your contribution, read the `Developer page <https://github.com/RARE-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Developer-page>`_ and implement it. Thanks!

Note that Github is not a medium for asking open-ended questions. Please use the `Gensim mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/gensim>`_ for that.
