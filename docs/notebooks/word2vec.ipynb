    "# Word2Vec Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you missed the buzz, word2vec is a widely featured as a member of the “new wave” of machine learning algorithms based on neural networks, commonly referred to as \"deep learning\" (though word2vec itself is rather shallow). Using large amounts of unannotated plain text, word2vec learns relationships between words automatically. The output are vectors, one vector per word, with remarkable linear relationships that allow us to do things like vec(“king”) – vec(“man”) + vec(“woman”) =~ vec(“queen”), or vec(“Montreal Canadiens”) – vec(“Montreal”) + vec(“Toronto”) resembles the vector for “Toronto Maple Leafs”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec is very useful in [automatic text tagging](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/movie-plots-by-genre), recommender systems and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out an [online word2vec demo](http://radimrehurek.com/2014/02/word2vec-tutorial/#app) where you can try this vector algebra for yourself. That demo runs `word2vec` on the Google News dataset, of **about 100 billion words**.\n",
