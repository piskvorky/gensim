    "### What is this tutorial about?\n",
    "This tutorial will exaplin what Dynamic Topic Models are, and how to use them using the LdaSeqModel class of gensim. I will start with some theory and already documented examples, before moving on to an example run of Dynamic Topic Model on a sample dataset. I will also do an comparison between the python code and the already present gensim wrapper, and illustrate how to easily visualise them and do topic coherence with DTM. Any suggestions to improve documentation or code through PRs/Issues is always appreciated!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Dynamic Topic Models?\n",
    "Imagine you have a gigantic corpus which spans over a couple of years. You want to find semantically similar documents; one from the very beginning of your time-line, and one in the very end. How would you?\n",
    "This is where Dynamic Topic Models comes in. By having a time-based element to topics, context is preserved while key-words may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "David Blei does a good job explaining the theory behind this in this [Google talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BMsuyBPx90). If you prefer to directly read the [paper on DTM by Blei and Lafferty](http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2036&context=compsci), that should get you upto speed too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his talk, Blei gives a very interesting example of the motivation to use DTM. After running DTM on a dataset of the Science Journal from 1880 onwards, he picks up [this](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/os-1/28/326) paper - The Brain of the Orang (1880). It's topics are concentrated on a topic which must be to do with Monkeys, and with Neuroscience or brains. \n",
    "<img src=\"Monkey Brains.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "He goes ahead to pick up another paper with likely very less common words, but in the same context - analysing monkey brains. In fact, this one is called - \"[Representation of the visual field on the medial wall of occipital-parietal cortex in the owl monkey](http://allmanlab.caltech.edu/PDFs/AllmanKaas1976.pdf)\". Quite the title, eh? Like mentioned before, you wouldn't imagine too many common words in these two papers, about a 100 years apart.\n",
    "<img src=\"Monkey Brains New.png\" witdth=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But a Hellinger Distance based Document-Topic distribution gives a very high similarity value! The same topics evolved smoothly over time and the context remains. A document similarity match using other traditional techniques might not work very well on this!\n",
    "Blei defines this technique as - \"Time corrected Document Similarity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another obviously useful analysis is to see how words in a topic change over time. The same broad classified topic starts looking more 'mature' as time goes on. This image illustrates an example from the same paper linked to above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Dynamic Topic Model.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So, briefly put : \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Topic Models are used to model the evolution of topics in a corpus, over time. The Dynamic Topic Model is part of a class of probabilistic topic models, like the LDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "While most traditional topic mining algorithms do not expect time-tagged data or take into account any prior ordering, Dynamic Topic Models (DTM) leverages the knowledge of different documents belonging to a different time-slice in an attempt to map how the words in a topic change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This](https://rare-technologies.com/understanding-and-coding-dynamic-topic-models/) blog post is also useful in breaking down the ideas and theory behind DTM.\n",

    "But - why even undertake this, especially when Gensim itself have a wrapper?\n",
    "The main motivation was the lack of documentation in the original code - and the fact that doing an only python version makes it easier to use gensim building blocks. For example, for setting up the Sufficient Statistics to initialize the DTM, you can just pass a pre-trained gensim LDA model!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some clarity on how they built their code now - Variational Inference using Kalman Filters, as described in section 3 of the paper. The mathematical basis for the code is well described in the appendix of the paper. If the documentation is lacking or not clear, comments via Issues or PRs via the gensim repo would be useful in improving the quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "So while there is already a python wrapper of DTM, a pure python implementation will be useful to better understand what goes on undcer the hood and tune our model. When it comes to performance, the C++ is undoubtedly faster, but we can continue to work on ours to make it as fast.\n",
    "As for evaluating the results, our topics are on par if not better than the wrapper!\n",
    "\n",
    "On a more personal note, implementing Dynamic Topic Models with the Google Summer of Code 2016 program was a great learning experience. Gensim and RaRe Technologies have been a joy to work with, and Lev and Radim have been great mentors throughout, especially when things became slow or difficult. \n",
