    "According to the paper [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606), embeddings for words are represented by the sum of their n-gram embeddings. This is meant to be useful for morphologically rich languages - so theoretically, the embedding for `apparently` would include information from both character n-grams `apparent` and `ly` (as well as other n-grams), and the n-grams would combine in a simple, linear manner. This is very similar to what most of our syntactic tasks look like.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try with a larger corpus now - text8 (collection of wiki articles). I'm especially curious about the impact on semantic accuracy - for models trained on the brown corpus, the difference in the semantic accuracy and the accuracy values themselves are too small to be conclusive. Hopefully a larger corpus helps, and the text8 corpus likely has a lot more information about capitals, currencies, cities etc, which should be relevant to the semantic tasks.\n"
