# # News classification with topic models in gensim
# News article classification is a task which is performed on a huge scale by news agencies all over the world. We will be looking into how topic modeling can be used to accurately classify news articles into different categories such as sports, technology, politics etc.
#
# Our aim in this tutorial is to come up with some topic model which can come up with topics that can easily be interpreted by us. Such a topic model can be used to discover hidden structure in the corpus and can also be used to determine the membership of a news article into one of the topics.
#
# For this tutorial, we will be using the Lee corpus which is a shortened version of the [Lee Background Corpus](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~mdlee/lee_pincombe_welsh_document.PDF). The shortened version consists of 300 documents selected from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's news mail service. It consists of texts of headline stories from around the year 2000-2001.
#
# Accompanying slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/dsquareindia/pycon-delhi-lightening).
#
# ### Requirements
# In this tutorial we look at how different topic models can be easily created using [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/).
# Following are the dependencies for this tutorial:
#     - Gensim Version >=0.13.1 would be preferred since we will be using topic coherence metrics extensively here.
#     - matplotlib
#     - Patterns library; Gensim uses this for lemmatization.
#     - nltk.stopwords
#     - pyLDAVis
# We will be playing around with 4 different topic models here:
#     - LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)
#     - HDP (Hierarchical Dirichlet Process)
#     - LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
#     - LDA (tweaked with topic coherence to find optimal number of topics) and
#     - LDA as LSI with the help of topic coherence metrics
# First we'll fit those topic models on our existing data then we'll compare each against the other and see how they rank in terms of human interpretability.
#
# All can be found in gensim and can be easily used in a plug-and-play fashion. We will tinker with the LDA model using the newly added topic coherence metrics in gensim based on [this](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/WSDM_Topic_Evaluation/public.pdf) paper by Roeder et al and see how the resulting topic model compares with the exsisting ones.

# ### Preprocessing our data. Remember: Garbage In Garbage Out
#                                         "NLP is 80% preprocessing."
#                                                                 -Lev Konstantinovskiy
# This is the single most important step in setting up a good topic modeling system. If the preprocessing is not good, the algorithm can't do much since we would be feeding it a lot of noise. In this tutorial, we will be filtering out the noise using the following steps in this order for each line:
# 1. Stopword removal using NLTK's english stopwords dataset.
# 2. Bigram collocation detection (frequently co-occuring tokens) using gensim's [Phrases](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html). This is our first attempt to find some hidden structure in the corpus. You can even try trigram collocation detection.
# 3. Lemmatization (using gensim's [`lemmatize`](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/utils.html#gensim.utils.lemmatize)) to only keep the nouns. Lemmatization is generally better than stemming in the case of topic modeling since the words after lemmatization still remain understable. However, generally stemming might be preferred if the data is being fed into a vectorizer and isn't intended to be viewed.

# ### Topic modeling with LSI
# This is a useful topic modeling algorithm in that it can rank topics by itself. Thus it outputs topics in a ranked order. However it does require a `num_topics` parameter (set to 200 by default) to determine the number of latent dimensions after the SVD.

# ### Topic modeling using [LDA](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/HoffmanBleiBach2010b.pdf)
# This is one the most popular topic modeling algorithms today. It is a generative model in that it assumes each document is a mixture of topics and in turn, each topic is a mixture of words. To understand it better you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDq3OVp9dNA) lecture by David Blei. Let's choose 10 topics to initialize this.

ldamodel = LdaModel(corpus=corpus, num_topics=10, id2word=dictionary)


# pyLDAvis is a great way to visualize an LDA model. To summarize in short, the area of the circles represent the prevelance of the topic. The length of the bars on the right represent the membership of a term in a particular topic. pyLDAvis is based on [this](http://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/papers/sievert-illvi2014.pdf) paper.

# ### Finding out the optimal number of topics
# __Introduction to topic coherence__:
# <img src="https://rare-technologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pipeline.png">
# Topic coherence in essence measures the human interpretability of a topic model. Traditionally [perplexity has been used](http://qpleple.com/perplexity-to-evaluate-topic-models/) to evaluate topic models however this does not correlate with human annotations at times. Topic coherence is another way to evaluate topic models with a much higher guarantee on human interpretability. Thus this can be used to compare different topic models among many other use-cases. Here's a short blog I wrote explaining topic coherence:

# ### Customizing the topic coherence measure
# Till now we only used the `c_v` coherence measure. There are others such as `u_mass`, `c_uci`, `c_npmi`. All of these calculate coherence in a different way. `c_v` is found to be most in line with human ratings but can be much slower than `u_mass` since it uses a sliding window over the texts.

# ### Making your own coherence measure
# Let's modify `c_uci` to use `s_one_pre` instead of `s_one_one` segmentation

# In[53]:

# __Step 4__: Aggregation

# In[54]:

# # How this topic model can be used further
# The best topic model here can be used as a standalone for news article classification. However a topic model can also be used as a dimensionality reduction algorithm to feed into a classifier. A good topic model should be able to extract the signal from the noise efficiently, hence improving the performance of the classifier.
