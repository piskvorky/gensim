    "# The author-topic model: LDA with metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the author-topic model in Gensim. First, we will apply it to a corpus consisting of scientific papers, to get insight about the authors of the papers. After that, we will apply the model on StackExchange posts with tags, and implement a simple automatic tagging system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author-topic model is in extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Each document is associated with a set of authors, and the topic distributions for each of these authors are learned. Each author is also associated with multiple documents. To learn about the theoretical side of the author-topic model, see [Rosen-Zvi and co-authors](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info6150/readings/398.pdf), for example.\n",
