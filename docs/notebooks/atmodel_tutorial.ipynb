    "# The author-topic model: LDA with metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the author-topic model in Gensim. We will apply it to a corpus consisting of scientific papers, to get insight about the authors of the papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author-topic model is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), that allows us to learn topic representations of authors in a corpus. The model can be applied to any kinds of labels on documents, such as tags on posts on the web. The model can be used as a novel way of data exploration, as features in machine learning pipelines, for author (or tag) prediction, or to simply leverage your topic model with existing metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about the theoretical side of the author-topic model, see [Rosen-Zvi and co-authors 2004](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info6150/readings/398.pdf), for example. A report on the algorithm used in the Gensim implementation will be available soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, familiarity with topic modelling, LDA and Gensim is assumed in this tutorial. If you are not familiar with either LDA, or its Gensim implementation, I would recommend starting there. Consider some of these resources:\n",
    "* Gentle introduction to the LDA model: http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/\n",
    "* Gensim's LDA API documentation: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html\n",
    "* Topic modelling in Gensim: http://radimrehurek.com/topic_modeling_tutorial/2%20-%20Topic%20Modeling.html\n",
    "* [Pre-processing and training LDA](lda_training_tips.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To run this tutorial on your own, install Jupyter, Gensim, SpaCy, Scikit-Learn, Bokeh and Pandas, e.g. using pip:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `pip install jupyter gensim spacy sklearn bokeh pandas`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note that you need to download some data for SpaCy using `python -m spacy.en.download`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Download the notebook at https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/tree/develop/docs/notebooks/atmodel_tutorial.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to prepare data for the model, how to train it, and how to explore the resulting representation in different ways. We will inspect the topic representation of some well known authors like Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, and compare authors by plotting them in reduced dimensionality and performing similarity queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing scientific papers\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using consists of scientific papers about machine learning, from the Neural Information Processing Systems conference (NIPS). It is the same dataset used in the [Pre-processing and training LDA](lda_training_tips.ipynb) tutorial, mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be performing qualitative analysis of the model, and at times this will require an understanding of the subject matter of the data. If you try running this tutorial on your own, consider applying it on a dataset with subject matter that you are familiar with. For example, try one of the [StackExchange datadump datasets](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the data from Sam Roweis' website (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html). Or just run the cell below, and it will be downloaded and extracted into your `tmp."

This is usually done when the corpus is too big to fit in memory. There are, however, some caveats to this functionality, which we will discuss here. As these caveats make this functionality less than ideal, it may be improved in the future.\n",

    "In the following, an explanation, followed by an example and a summarization will be given.\n",

    "\n",
    "The user must specify the path where the model should serialize all input documents, for example `serialization_path='/tmp/model_serializer.mm'`. To avoid accidentally overwriting some important data, the model will raise an error if there already exists a file at `serialization_path`; in this case, either choose another path, or delete the old file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to train on new data, and call `model.update(corpus, author2doc)`, all the old data and the new data have to be re-serialized. This can of course be quite computationally demanding, so it is recommended that you do this *only* when necessary; that is, wait until you have as much new data as possible to update, rather than updating the model for every new document."
