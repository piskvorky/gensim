So that we basically end up with a new 2d or 3d embedding which tries to preserve information from the original multi-dimensional embedding. As these vectors are reduced to a much smaller dimension, the exact cosine/euclidean distances between them are not preserved, but rather relative, and hence as you’ll see below the nearest similarity results may change.\n",

    "- **Principal Component Analysis**: PCA aims at exploring the global structure in data, and could end up losing the local similarities between neighbours. It maximizes the total variance in the lower dimensional subspace and hence, often preserves the larger pairwise distances better than the smaller ones. See an intuition behind it in this nicely explained [answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/176672/what-is-meant-by-pca-preserving-only-large-pairwise-distances) on stackexchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-SNE**: The idea of T-SNE is to place the local neighbours close to each other, and almost completely ignoring the global structure. It is useful for exploring local neighborhoods and finding local clusters. But the global trends are not represented accurately and the separation between different groups is often not preserved (see the t-sne plots of our data below which testify the same).\n",
    "\n",

The first one is Perplexity, which is basically a measure of information. It may be viewed as a knob that sets the number of effective nearest neighbors[2]. The second one is learning rate that defines how quickly an algorithm learns on encountering new examples/data points.\n",

But some small clusters will start forming as above, with different orientations.\n",

    "I named some clusters above based on the genre of it's movies and also using the `show_topic()` to see relevant terms of the topic which was most prevelant in a cluster. Most of the clusters had doocumets belonging dominantly to a single topic. For ex. The cluster with movies belonging primarily to topic 0 could be named Fantasy/Romance based on terms displayed below for topic 0. You can play with the visualization yourself on this [link](http://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parulsethi/LdaProjector/master/doc_lda_config.json) and try to conclude a label for clusters based on movies it has and their dominant topic. You can see the top 5 topics of every point by hovering over it.\n",

    "Now, we can notice that their are more than 10 clusters in the above image, whereas we trained our model for `num_topics=10`. It's because their are few clusters, which has documents belonging to more than one topic with an approximately close topic probability values."

    "The weight parameter λ can be viewed as a knob to adjust the ranks of the terms based on whether they are simply ranked according to their probability in the topic (λ=1) or are normalized by their marginal probability across the corpus (λ=0). Setting λ=1 could result in similar ranking of terms for large no. of topics hence making it difficult to differentiate between them, and setting λ=0 ranks terms solely based on their exclusiveness to current topic which could result in such rare terms that occur in only a single topic and hence the topics may remain difficult to interpret. [(Sievert and Shirley 2014)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/papers/sievert-illvi2014.pdf) suggested the optimal value of λ=0.6 based on a user study."

    "We learned about visualizing the Document Embeddings and LDA Doc-topic distributions through Tensorboard's Embedding Projector. It is a useful tool for visualizing different types of data for example, word embeddings, document embeddings or the gene expressions and biological sequences. It just needs an input of 2D tensors and then you can explore your data using provided algorithms. You can also perform nearest neighbours search to find most similar data points to your query point.\n",
