So that we basically end up with a new 2d or 3d embedding which tries to preserve information from the original multi-dimensional embedding. As these vectors are reduced to a much smaller dimension, the exact cosine/euclidean distances between them are not preserved, but rather relative, and hence as you’ll see below the nearest similarity results may change.\n",

    "- **Principal Component Analysis**: PCA aims at exploring the global structure in data, and could end up losing the local similarities between neighbours. It maximizes the total variance in the lower dimensional subspace and hence, often preserves the larger pairwise distances better than the smaller ones. See an intuition behind it in this nicely explained [answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/176672/what-is-meant-by-pca-preserving-only-large-pairwise-distances) on stackexchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-SNE**: The idea of T-SNE is to place the local neighbours close to each other, and almost completely ignoring the global structure. It is useful for exploring local neighborhoods and finding local clusters. But the global trends are not represented accurately and the separation between different groups is often not preserved (see the t-sne plots of our data below which testify the same).\n",

The cluster with movies belonging primarily to topic 0 could be named Fantasy/Romance based on terms displayed below for topic 0. You can play with the visualization yourself on this [link](http://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parulsethi/LdaProjector/master/doc_lda_config.json) and try to conclude a label for clusters based on movies it has and their dominant topic.

    "We learned about visualizing the Document Embeddings and LDA Doc-topic distributions through Tensorboard's Embedding Projector. It is a useful tool for visualizing different types of data for example, word embeddings, document embeddings or the gene expressions and biological sequences. It just needs an input of 2D tensors and then you can explore your data using provided algorithms. You can also perform nearest neighbours search to find most similar data points to your query point.\n",
