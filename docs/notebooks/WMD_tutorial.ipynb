    "# Word Mover's Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Mover's Distance (WMD) is a new and exciting method in machine learning that helps us measure the similarity of two sentences. WMD can be used for document retrieval, and has been shown to outperform many of the current state-of-the-art methods in $k$-nearest neighbors classification [1]. As we shall see, the benefit of WMD is that we can accurately assess the similarity of two documents, even when they have no words in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "WMD uses word2vec vector embeddings [2] of words (read about word2vec in Gensim [here](http://rare-technologies.com/deep-learning-with-word2vec-and-gensim/) and [here](http://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "WMD is illustrated below for two very similar sentences. The sentences have no words in common, but by matching the relevant words, WMD is able to accurately measure the similarity between the two sentences. The method also uses the bag-of-words representation of the documents (simply put, the word's frequencies in the documents), noted as $d$ in the figure below. The intution behind the method is that we find the minimum \"traveling distance\" between documents, the most efficient way to \"move\" the distribution of document 1 to the distribution of document 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This method was introduced in the article \"From Word Embeddings To Document Distances\" by Matt Kusner et al. ([link to PDF](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/kusnerb15.pdf)). It is inspired by the \"Earth Mover's Distance\", and employs a solver of the \"transportation problem\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Gensim's WMD functionality, which consists of the `wmdistance` method for distance computation, and the `WmdSimilarity` class for corpus based similarity queries.\n",

Download these embeddings [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit). Training your own embeddings can be beneficial, but to simplify this tutorial, we will be using pre-trained embeddings at first.\n",
