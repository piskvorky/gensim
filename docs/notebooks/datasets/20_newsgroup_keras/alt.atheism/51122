Define perfect then.
I think you are playing the usual game here, make sweeping statements like omniholy, or perfect, and don't note that they mean exactly what they say.
And that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to contradictions.
I'm not trying to play games here.
But I understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as atheism.
Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian.
The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.
Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time.
But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.
Now God could have prevented Lucifer's fall by taking away his ability to choose between moral alternatives (worship God or worship himself), but that would mean that God was in error to have make Lucifer or any being with free will in the first place.
Exactly. God allows evil, an evil if there ever was one.
Now that's an opinion, or at best a premise.
But from my point of view, it is not a premise which is necessary true, specifically, that it is an evil to allow evil to occur.
It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.
