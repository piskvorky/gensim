Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball League (pure fantasy baseball teams).
Unfortunely, we are running the league using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats for the 1992 season. (Preferably the 1992 Major League Stat Disk)
We have the '92 total stats but EWB2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200 inning games because the Comm.
Disk turns total stats into vs. L's stats unless you know both right and left -handed stats.
So, if anyone has the EWB2 '92 Stat Disk please e-mail me!
