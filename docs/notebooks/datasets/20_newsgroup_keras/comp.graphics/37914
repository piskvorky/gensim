Can someone please tell me where I can ftp DTA or DMORPH?
DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory on the wuarchive.
They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions, dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or dtax.exe.
I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing away the afternoons since.
The programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very well written.
The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks.
I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option.
Not sure why, since I don't have the source.
I think it was written for TP 6.0.
If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then it would work
