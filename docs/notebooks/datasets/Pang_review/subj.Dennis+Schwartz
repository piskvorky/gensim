in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . -ed . ] when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . rating : * [lowest rating] |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13 
you can watch this movie , that is based on a sci-fi work by robert heinlein , either as a straight gung-ho war film , or you can see it mostly as a spoof . anyway you watch it won't require too much gray matter from your brain cells , because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes , or you might , like me , " think " that this film is so bad that it really couldn't be this bad , i must be missing something . but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b- movie , is that bad , despite the high production costs it took to make it . if there are any good parts to this film , it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner , such as this one , that makes light of the film's heavy assault on our sensibilities , as one soldier is telling the hero of the story , " you're good at killing bugs . " basically , the film should be seen as a war movie , because its spoof of the military , grew thin very fast for me , as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped , going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place , that by spending so much time with spoofing the military , is just plain unnecessary . i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation . after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military . i don't think you get much bang for your money out of this film , unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary , then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww11 into an outer space conflagration film . 
this is asking a lot to believe , and though it is possible , it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch , because he sure couldn't act , and since he is the focal point of all the attention , able to have his way with either men or women , we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen , instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldn't see it . just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship , that would make it interesting ? i'm afraid i don't have the answer , since i can't find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it , as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle , and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background , which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself , even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers , and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert , who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career , but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance . the only problem with this , is that we didn't see how good the sex was , we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good , as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever , but their love was not passionate or credible . there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing , when at a fashion party for dominque's wealthy parisian fashion clients , quentin tells her , " seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke . " quentin must be psychic or something , because he was just regurgitating what i was thinking about the characters in this film . 
no heroes and no story are the main attributes for this futile attempt at a trainspotting , performance , the long good friday , and a tarantino-like gangster/comedy , all rolled into one film , served up with an eastender's sense of vile english humor , as this is writer/director guy ritchie's first feature film , formerly known for his video commercials . he tries every bit he could muster from the lore of gangster and screwball comedies , to make this film work , but still misses by a city mile . this is just a bad film . a laurel and hardy film would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric effort . every character in the film tries to be a character , succeeding only in being a one-dimensional one , while women do not play a significant part in this unoriginal film , as they are reduced to being go-go girls or unnoticeable druggies . ritchie's aim for the film , is to keep the audience guessing at what is happening . the film gets carried away with trying to be too clever , as one character is always trying to top the other in craziness . the plot has its twists and turns , and it would serve no purpose telling you about it , since the heart of the film , is about the surprises and corpses it delivers . since the film's humor didn't suit me and i grew tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie , with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of stereotypes ; and , the violence didn't particularly appeal to me , either , leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure . if you take my advise , you'd avoid this one . i think you would get more satisfaction , if you are hooked on this type of film , in seeing something like reservoir dogs , even if you must see it again , it is better than seeing this poor imitation once . 
this is not an art movie , yet i saw it an art house theater . it is perfect for the mall , where teenagers experiencing brain drains can feel good about being mindless and not have to apologize that this is an american film , about that old cliche of young lovers relentlessly on the run . if seen at your friendly mall , you could , at least , be reassured that there is little chance of anyone trying to sneak it in as an art film , as was tried in the art house . rlr should make it apparent that other countries can make obnoxious films with banal and predictable characters just as readily as americans can . there is no substance in this fast food german meal , served up at a deliciously kinetic speed so that you have no time to think about how stupid the story is and how depraved the lead characters are , and what a lousy meal you have just had . the film is as deep as reading a daffy duck comic book or playing a road runner video game or watching a bugs bunny cartoon , and if that entertains you , then perhaps , i could recommend that you take a look at run lola run , it might be what you are looking for . it has the audacity to have in its opening credits a quote from t . s . in all probability , the blue-bloodied elliott would not have cared for this film- and to quote him and then have a film that has nothing in the world to do with his poem or with the quote , except to show that even these crass critters who created this film aspire to a higher art form , is simply a ridiculous attempt by them to try and achieve credibility when it is not necessary to do so , this film stands on its own four paws . these questions once asked on screen are , of course , never even attempted to be answered . though it would have been good comedic dialogue to have the two leads , lola ( franka potente ) and manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) , try to resolve these deep philosophical questions . what does take place is a soccer ball being kicked to open the action in the film , as the movie is supposed to be like a game , with the director making up the rules as he goes along . manni , not to be undone , sports a few nifty tattoos himself , while also taking on the punk look . the fun to this story , if you are going to have any , comes in following lola as she makes a run for it through spots that she will revisit three different times each for 20-minutes and with three different versions , before the film is over , as any one of the versions could be true or none of them could be true , it just doesn't matter . nothing matters , here . this is a disposable film , like junk food , when done you throw it in the waste can . needless to say , anything goes here ; this film does not try to make sense and it doesn't . its comedy is on the low end of the totem pole of comedy , though the old silent comedians , such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton did bits similar to this , but they had a logic to their madcap humor and knew how to tell a story in their comedy . there are so many films that tried this theme out for size , some successfully like rashomon ( 1950 ) , some modestly successful like blind chance ( 1982 ) , others less successfully , such as sliding doors ( 1998 ) , but none as unsuccessful as this one . at least this subtitled , low-budget film flew by quickly and leaves you no worst for wear after seeing it . . . it certainly didn't appeal to me ; i was just not smitten with its attempt to be such a cleverly edited , jejune summer film . and he replies , " i just know . " well , i just know i didn't like this film . 
a satirical film where warren beatty tries to talk the black man's rap to get across his political message : which is that there's something wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it . maybe he does this because he feels relieved that he's going to die soon . this is an awkardly embarrassing scene , that was more embarrassing than funny to watch beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers . it reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited the black panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so chic . even frank capra wasn't that schmaltzy . the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible , it is just bad filmmaking ; but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it , for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray . amiri baraka ( poet & playwright ) , supposedly a voice of consciousness , plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene , uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap , " we need no more ghosts , we need a spirit . " the fault of the film , is that beatty can't gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it , like he's the white man who knows best what to do , and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor ( sic ) . everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for beatty to lay it into them with his political cliches . just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw , along comes this sophomoric venture , showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new so-called truths , and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in silliness and prattle , unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected , except what is implied , that the people will trust him because he's so hip and daring , and he's just so with it . there was a smugness about this film that made its childish political voice seem more annoying than it should be , even taking away any enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts . beatty is just not the filmmaker i would want telling my side of the story . all he has done is make a film that is cliched and overbearing and funny in a not funny way , and he sounds no different or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film , clinton and dole . and , i don't mean that as a compliment . 
this sci-fi'er left a lot to be desired . it didn't work out in 3-d , its original intention of how it was to be shown , as the public's taste for that fad cooled , or in the conventional 2-d , how it was actually shown when released . for the first 30 minutes or so i felt i was stuck in a detention classroom for dummies ( ah ! even if these machines could do a 1 , 000 times the work man can do , they were also a 1 , 000 times deadlier than man , and this reactionary story dwells on the negative side of what machines could do , even if the machine in this instance is a magnificent brain . the action in the film , which is none too thrilling , is in watching how many of the 150 workers will get killed and what novel ways are the killings to be done . if the film was funny or its technology was more interesting , or if the killings weren't so melodramatic , and the acting not so staid , and the patriotic jingoism wasn't so shrill , i might have found this film bearable . but since that wasn't the case , i found the film to be an academic bore . 
this is a dull , unfunny film , lacking an edge to it , as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch . this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv ; it should have come with canned laughter . in the theater i saw it , no one laughed ; and , watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling . the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire . even if the story never took off , i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore . i thought brooks mailed this script in . it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier . he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some " summer script " he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie . if he was trying for a parody ( which i assume he was ) , he just didn't succeed . all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the " fat cats " who make up the hollywood scene , too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it . but i think the main problem with the film , besides the fact that it's a one idea film , is how that idea was weak and never developed . the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was . i feel i must question the film's intent : why should i feel sorry for brooks ? where is the comedy in the film ? what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean ? what kind of statement is he making about creativity ? should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired ? is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i ? and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film . what goes for comedy in this film , has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse . that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care . this is " i love lucy " kind of humor . that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity , is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept . if you make a satire , it better be funny , or if it is a more serious film , it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive . to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person . this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film . if you really had to see this film , the only reason i could think of doing so , was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse . even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny , she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance . at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was . 
instead he makes him an offer he can't very well refuse , stay with me and i'll give you everything you want . it all turns out to be a tedious game to see who is in control : brains or brawn . the kid plays his part like he's a lump of coal and the sex is so uninviting , making it seem just as boring as watching paint dry on a wall . and like all the characters in this film , is not developed . there is no rhyme or reason for all this sleaze to be taking place , except for making the audience into voyeurs , like the invalid . what is quickly resolved , is that glover isn't queer , just manipulaive and mentally sick . that explanation of him doesn't ring true , anyway , as he always has a blank and uninteresting look on his face , and nothing he does throughout the film is taking him to anything but a dead-end . so it becomes hard to feel anything for him , but pity and contempt . the sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of helen , but the menage a trois doesn't have the nuances , wit , or actors to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away with . it becomes obvious that glover has a death-wish and has been preparing all-the-time for this and now seems ready , as he reads from a poem by a zen monk who is about to die , which goes something like this-- " in all my 56-years alive , i've seen no miracles . it is okay to die today . but even that attempt to get some life into the story fizzled , as the film just wound down trying to outsmart itself with shockers to its denouement , but ended up not being a very thrilling thriller or even living up to its reputation of being a controversial film . it was just a dull , exploitive movie , distinguished only by the fine performance of a good actor , pete postlethwaite , who was overwhelmed by being in such a trying film . 
vibrant culture . great people . thinking of hanging out here for a while . eat the rich . if i got a postcard like that , i would think of getting a new best friend . this is a story which turns out to be so flat and without emotion and plays like a film you can almost swear you saw before even if you didn't , that's how forgettable and regretable the story and the acting are . it almost makes you wonder what the filmmaker is trying to say about this trite conundrum his protaganist has . the film never comes to any surprises or reveals anything you wouldn't have known if you didn't see the film . which is why , i would think the sensible thing to do for those who value how they spend their time , would be to avoid this one . at least , that's what i would do if i had it to do over . but that's not to say that the film was so terrible that it can't be seen , that would not be true , since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull that it negates any enjoyment value . why toni is a poet , we have to take as a statement of fact coming from the filmmaker , because he appears like an obnoxious jerk and an actor who is badly miscast , and there was no evidence given in the film that he shows even enough intelligence to spell poet , let alone to even consider him to be a poet . chris , as a bohemian , was too pathetic to seriously believe and not funny enough to laugh at . but what was really laughable , was the filmmaker's bourgeois conception of what a bohemian is . what's left for the story to tell , are those predictable scenes of the friend who is not the friend he pretends to be , but someone who is jealous of his friend' material comforts and satisfying marriage . there's a new bresson playing . " this film will not be mistaken for a bresson . trust me on that . the film was able to muster one great line of dialogue , and it comes from marion , as she tells her hapless hubby , " you will get married because you are not original enough not to . " 
a " hollow-wood " production that couldn't be more hollow or hollywood in style , and to its only benefit , is visually pleasing . it presents a classic mysterious aura about it through scenes of thick fog , horrid decapitations , and framed shots as if it was a period art picture coming off its frame and onto the screen . but the story , that's a different story ; it is abominable . it is so ridiculous and incredulous that the filmmaker completely ruins washington irving's great short story . it is not the imaginative parable it was meant to be , but a story about a serial killer . so , you can forget the book , obviously tim burton did , that is if he ever read it . the film is not helped by a cast ( i might add a rather talented cast of british and americans ) that are sleepwalking through their parts . the two stars , who have inane and unappealing and underwritten roles , and seem to be acting as if they have no idea of what they are saying or doing in this film , but seem to enjoy playing it up for the camera , while showing no chemistry for any romance to be deemed possible between them ; which , without the two stars being credible performers , the film has little chance of succeeding . this film has box office appeal as a date movie for the high school set , comforting each other as they snack on popcorn ( which the theater owners will be largely appreciative of ) , and the teens , in all probability , will be reacting with bemused glee or mock horror to all the packets of ketchup unleashed during the headless horseman's romp through the sleepy hollow of 1799 . who else this movie should appeal to , is not for me to judge . but , when the audience leaves the theater , no harm is done , this is a totally forgettable film . there is no need to worry about nightmares over the gratuitous violence seen . this one is so obviously just a movie , that it can't even begin to match the book for its eloquence and the great manner of the book's very germane writing style , that is both lucid and thought provoking . if anything good can be said about this film , it would be that it brings back to the public's attention the forgotten writer washington irwing , someone who knew how to craft a ghost story back in the turn-of-the-19th-century and is still very readable . it's just too bad that a good movie couldn't result from such an accessible work . it's best to forget about this movie as in any way connected with the novel , the only thing that seems to jive is the time period , the location , and the character called ichabod crane ( depp ) . from here on , the movie is off on its own tangent , playing havoc with the story . in the movie the horseman is real , and the story becomes a vulgar mystery with some inept attempt to bring in an air of magical mystery to it , and it almost completely ignores the romantic rivalry between the two suitors , which was at the heart of irving's story . how a film could go so far afield , is not unusual for hollywood , but in this case the film has gone too far afield from the story to even claim it is based on the book . i would suggest reading the short story ( about 40-pages ) before or after seeing the film , and then see what you think of the film . i read the book after the film and am grateful that it called washington irving to my attention , again . otherwise , i can't say enough bad things about the film's crass aim to take away the imagination of the story and replace it with not one shred of what irving was after in his ghost story about romantic jealousy but here becoming a story about jejune classical horror images and a tacked on banal murder story . i'll admit , the movie looked good , better than most horror movies i might have raved about , but even with all the gory murders taking place and an excuse for a who-done-it movie evolving , a tedium set-in and the film seemed to lack suspense , breath and dimension ; and , like a beautiful person without much else , what else can you say that is complimentary after you say , you look good ! 
it was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on catholicism is , but seeing is believing . kevin smith ( clerks/mallrats/chasing amy ) has shown what it takes to make a satire that isn't funny and one that doesn't have enough bite in it to be subversive ( it is not shocking to know that the director is a practising catholic ) . this one is a yawner , one in which i found it difficult to sit through , as its two hours of belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that ; and , it was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's inane indulgent musings on religion , as he tries to gross the audience out with foul language , sight gags of unpleasant sights , such as a pile of shit emerging from a toilet bowl , and an irrelevant premise for an argument against catholicism , an argument that is about as crude a one as i have heard in some time . it is also a film that left me disgusted not only because of its banal argument against catholicism , but because it was a wise-guy film , shot with a sneer , by someone without the temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film . the filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious argument with one of silliness , spending most of his time lecturing and moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of view , as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing , that there is politics in the catholic church . the film's original distributor , miramax , ran into trouble with the catholic league who complained about the film's sacrilegious content and therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio , lion's gate . the protestors were right about one thing , the film is offensive . but they are wasting their time protesting , this movie shouldn't be banned ( i don't want to see films banned ) . this film's only crime is that it is a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr , we have enough martyrs in the world already . take my word for it , seeing god in this film is anticlimactic . that carlin , a natural comedian , is not funny in this role , a role that is ready-made for comedy , indicates how poorly things are going for smith . the premise of " dogma , " is that glick's church re-dedication will allow the banished angels to re-enter heaven , thus proving god fallible and , thereby , negating all existence . fiorentino and rickman are flat and unconvincing in their roles , getting neither comedy nor drama out of their performance , just giving me a mild headache listening to them deliver their vacuous lines . catholic dogma declares god's word to be unquestioned and to be a good catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it . the problem with these revelations , is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered in such a jarring manner , as if the actors were puppets just mouthing words that seemed out of place . there was just no flow in this film , just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking . to take this film seriously is a big mistake , which is why i have no sympathy for protestors of this film . if you got some laughs out of this mishmash , then you got more than i did from it . i just felt relieved that i sat through it and didn't walk out . smith appears to be a very limited director , he can't shoot action scenes , and his film was childish and unfocused . it was one of the most disappointing films i have seen , so far , in 1999 , especially noting how it got some favorable comments when shown in film festivals in america and abroad . what is particularly disturbing for me , is that his religious message isn't wrong -faith should not be a burden but a blessing , and his view on the corporate heads who finance films , who worship only money , is not something that i entirely disagree with , i just don't see him as the one delivering this message . 
hollywood adaptations of plays rarely come off much worse than this b&w one did . there is no kind way to put it otherwise , or to say if only it did this or that the film could have been saved , nor is there reason to say , if the acting was better the film could have been bearable . the problem with the film starts firstly with the casting of the two main actors . whenever they were on screen the film was unwatchable . the first-time actress who was chosen as a result of a national talent search for a newcomer for the part , was won by the iowa teen-ager , jean seberg , who doesn't have whatever inner strength it takes to be joan of arc , at least she doesn't have it at this point of her career , and should have not been cast in that part ; her shrill voice does not make for a naive peasant girl who hears the voice of god , nor does the closing of her eyes portend that she is a visionary . richard widmark , who played the future king charles vii , the dauphin , as if he were jerry lewis in one of those stupid lewis and martin comedies of the 1950s , was not a good casting decision either . he appeared to be ridiculous emoting in his spastic gestures at the camera , as if he was in the wrong film and didn't understand that this one wasn't meant to be a comedy . the story had no emotional appeal or urgent power , and seemed like it was shot by a rank amateur filmmaker who had no idea how to get coherence from a scene and real passion from his performers , in a story that was supposedly all about passion , this one had none . it was an exercise in futility and arrogance on the part of the director , a thumbing his nose at anyone who disagrees that he is a great filmmaker and that he could make any type of film . it is no surprise that there was no audience for this film , that film critics roasted it , and that the ever-arrogant preminger sneered back at them in contempt . but if he wanted to know what joan was all about , he should have observed carl dreyer's masterpiece " the passion of joan of arc " ( 28 ) , and he would have seen the spiritual qualities the story was imbued with and realized that his version had failed to capture the power of the story and why the argument against the church in the story means so much to so many , and for such a long time the story poetically moved a people interested in those who have visions . that scene is my all-time favorite . it was unbelievable . its worth seeing the film just for that . with joan , all high-and-mighty on her steed , shouting out things like , " i get my orders from god , " this film was just too much of a brain-drainer . it was filmmaking at preminger's worst . well , if you're in joan's shoes , and you really believe you're tuned into god , you have no choice but to continue to listen to those voices in your head . what was a great actor like john doing here , and to the bargain , why was he wasted in such a small role ? maybe , if he could have played both joan and king charles this dog would have had legs ! but the film never made it seem like she was anything but a quack , committing herself to a self-imposed death , and she is always seen behaving irrationally . there was no justification for the story's outcome , no power in its presentment , and its style suffered from an ill-humor . preminger , takes a cue from one of the lines in the film , when joan says , " i always know i'm right- because i hear the voices . " 
everything about these girl-to-girl conversations seemed forced . she does not make a loud scene , but rather lawyer-like presents her case against him . she tells connie : " you're even older than me , and you're f * cking my daughter . " it is awe . " connie- whose reaction is of visible hurt , replies " you're quite a woman , deborah . " and that's the gist of the movie . though it does drag on for an excrutiatingly embarrassing forty more minutes , until it predictably shows harper overcoming her problems of feeling inadequate . the film heads down a road of corn ball contrivances , that kill any chance for this story to be taken seriously . it was very difficult to watch these talented performers saying all this soap opera mush , which trivialized what could have been an interesting film about a woman learning to become a woman through sex , if in the hands of a more capable director/screenwriter . polley is a fine actress and her performance when first encountering sex , is one of nervous apprehension and childish giggles . but that brief scene , as powerful as it was , was not enough to save this mawkish film for first-time director audrey wells . 
at best , this tv film of sherlock , is moderate fare . it suffers from wooden acting , flat direction , and trite dialogue . it was as if huston was reading his lines from cue cards , which made his confrontations with sherlock unduly dry . what the film did have going for it , was a clever plot and a few gimmicks it hung its hat on , which made it passably interesting for awhile , at least enough for me to continue watching so i could see how sherlock resolves the complicated case he is working on . this is usual sherlock stuff , except the film never had an excitement or sense of urgency to it . any romance , seemed out of the question , as the two stars seemed like cold kippers , afraid to even touch each other . in the end , everything seemed technically correct about the production , but it never had any life to it . i would chalk this sherlock version up as a mistake and , if i were in the mood to see a sherlock , i would stick to seeing any of the basil rathbone ones of the 1940s , especially his " sherlock holmes and the spider woman . " 
i should have been so lucky to have been gone from the theater in 60 seconds ; but , i sat through this two hour remake of the slender film " gone " ( 1974 ) , an original film that was so shallow , everything else seen that year must have seemed deep by comparison . it's hard to get lower in moral decrepitude than this car current booster film . this was not only a bad film but a particularly annoying one . this is a jerry bruckheimer productions , which has come to stand for mediocrity in artistic value but for success in the box office , which will probably mirror how this film does , though it is a little worst artistically speaking than his other mediocre films , as if that will supposedly matter to its target audience . to make up for not coming prepared with a script that made sense , a stellar cast was hired but then was asked to do nothing , instead some gorgeous vintage cars were put on display and each was given a girl's name . everything about the story was kept hyper , as mindless violence won out over gratuitous sex , to become the major selling point of this exploitive film . the action begins right from the opening credits . the thrill of the film now becomes in watching the crew be selected , which includes angelina jolie , chi mcbride , james duval , and scott caan , none of whom are in the least bit interesting or funny . jolie seems to disappear for most of the film , only to reappear much later in the film and mumble a few inconsequential lines . there's basically no story or dialogue , the action is all packaged like commercials are with gloss and trick shots , colored filters , fast-paced editing , and all the other tricks of the trade the directors for jerry bruckheimer use to sell the action sequences . everything about this film seemed ridiculous . its logic for being could be taken apart at any point of the film . the moral bankruptcy it presented , that lindo would just let cage and his crew off the hook for all the thefts , was too much to comprehend . it was so weak to hear lindo say to cage , " well , you saved my life , and i guess it was a brotherly thing you did for your brother , so i'm going to let you go , now get out of here before i change my mind . " if i had my wish , lindo should go to jail for failing to do his job . the director should go to work in duvall's body shop and never direct another film . and , this senseless macho film should die a slow death at the box office , so films like this would become extinct like dinosaurs . i should be so lucky . . . 
this is the last film made by the celebrated italian neorealist . it was an unbearably dull and simplistic film : poorly acted and with a vile and inaccurate depiction of jews , the scenery consisted of gaudy tv stage sets , and there was just no emotion drawn from the story . it was so badly done , that it seemed like all the figures were wooden . it therefore doesn't surprise me that this film was rarely seen , even in europe , the producers were probably happy to bury it . rossellini showed his love for film as an amateur by making short subject films . this was strictly a propaganda film and il duce's son was the film's supervisor . he made a few more fascist-commissioned films and in 1943 he shot desiderio , which was a precursor of his trademarked neorealist style to come later . together they made stromboli ( 49 ) , a film that i liked very much and thought it was underrated . he also made strangers in 1953 , which might be the best film he made during this period . the romans are made to seem like benign rulers , only too glad to please the jews and grant them their wish . the cruelty of the romans was never even hinted at . rossellini also took the religion out of jesus and made the rabbi seem as if he was merely a moralist , who was more a humanitarian and a mr . nice guy than anything else . i found this a difficult film to find anything in it that was praiseworthy . the director was trying to go back to film in his neorealism style , but couldn't even come close to duplicating the passionate films he is best remembered for . this film is only for those who feel compelled to see all of rossellini's films from 1936-1978 , the good , the bad , and the ugly . 
this is one of those films that you feel ashamed you saw . the characters appear to be not as bad as they seem , or as good as they seem--they just seem to be vapid . it is a film that has no direction or sense of what it wants to say , except to look good like commercials do and with the hope that it can be accepted as a " feel good " movie by the kind of public that will see anything in the summer as long as the film moves fast . everything about this film is a sham , from the repulsive bar it highlights to the inane relationship it features . it felt like i was dropped into a pit with some of the most obnoxious types you would ever want to meet and was told that the only way to get out of this trap , was to shake my ass like they do . his role is to be an adult , crack some jokes , try to give the film a heart , and not to seem too embarrassed when he is reduced to shaking his ass on top of that ugly frathouse dream bar the film has created to do its flashdance formula film again , but this time without fresh music or script . his only noteworthy habit is collecting rare comic books . because of all the trickery involved , doubles for the bargirls were used . it seems odd to have only one enforcer in a place that is built for trouble , but then again , hardly anything about this film made sense . but , i'd like to see violet try and convince anyone who is not brain dead that this film has a modicum of intelligence in it . an actor could only hope to come out of a film like this unscathed , that piper perabo does , is a credit to her , which is probably due to the innocent kindergarten teacher look she conveys . the film received a pg rating , despite its image of a bar from hell . but there are no hot sex scenes to satisy an audience it might be appealing to . . . i haven't a clue who this movie will please , but it sure isn't me . 
this one's a bomb . it's a total special effect film , sapping away what is human about the characters , while unsuccessfully putting the human characteristics into the haunted house . the house is the star of the film and the actors are the props . this insipid horror story has little to recommend it ; it wasn't scary , or campy , or well acted , it was just unimaginative . the few thrills it offers , are all a result of special effects . this is a date film more than anything else . the real horror it provided , was zapping shirley jackson's very literate psychological thriller . a far better film version , one that was actually thrilling , is the one done in 1963 by robert wise . the director of this film , jan de bont ( speed/speed 2/ twister ) , is not up to dealing with a psychological story and directing characters in a persuasive way , he is more into making silly theme movies that rely solely on special effects . the man just can't make a literate film . this house is haunted hollywood style , as the gothic house , which theo describes as a cross between something charles foster kane would build and the munsters' house , becomes the central focus of the film and the insomniacs stay away trying to look afraid of what they are seeing . it's all hokum from beginning to end , and it is so poorly scripted , that tedium quickly sets in , leaving the film with no purpose except to be laughed at for how stupid it all is . since this thriller was never thrilling , it just went on to show off the stage set designs illustriously created by eugenio zanetti , all one could do was go from room to room and stare at the cherubs , the leaping skeletons , the elaborately built stairway collapsing , an animated hand of a ghost coming out of the fountain , and at the futile effort to make a disney fantasy picture . after the film exhausts itself with its fake horror show and we see the ghost of hill house chasing after nell , the film gets a few laughs it never intended to get , as it concludes as a show-off will , when he is so proud of his wealthy house , that he thinks he has really impressed you , and continues to show-and-tell long after one has lost interest . the laughs that were gleaned , are of the kind that do not bode well for the film , they are the laughs that come from those who know they have just seen a bad film . 
the simple message this one-note film envisions , is that one should never be who they are not . the debut feature of jamie babbit is unabashedly awkward and to make matters worse , she can't get the cast to stop mugging for the camera . the comedy was lame , the characters were not interesting , only the idea was good if it could have been developed into a story with more dimensions than the one it belabored . the stupidity of trying to force someone against their will from being a homosexual , is treated as a heavy-handed 'saturday night live' satire routine . there was not enough of a story for it to be released as a movie . it was painful to watch this kind of kitsch for 80 or so minutes , which seemed to drag on for a hellish eternity . it is just as tortorous watching this film as it probably is going through such an indoctrination program . he is also the groundskeeper making sexual gestures with his chain-saw , who camps it up to the point of going over-the-top , losing all proportion for his character as being anything but a cartoon figure . his exaggerated gait and suppresed gay tendencies never materialized as funny stuff , just a bad script he was stuck with which was made more unbearable by his obnoxious performance . all the boys in the camp were sorry sights , offering neither comedy nor concern for them . clea is the only one in the film who belonged in this film and made the most of her role , making it believable as the rich bitchy girl who knows damn well that she's a lesbo , but also knows that if she doesn't go through with this farce of a rehab program , her parents will take away the trust fund she stands to inherit . the absurdity of the film is highlighted in its loud set designs , as the girls are overwhelmed with garish pink and tangerine colored outfits and room furnishings , while the boys are furnished with this hideous bright blue color . the other absurdity is in how artificial the planned steps are and how meaningless it is to graduate from a program such as this one . this is not a good campy film , and to the bargain , after trying to get laughs for the first half of the film , it then starts to take itself seriously . but the theme is so absurd , that there really is no message that can be delivered . everything about it is strained . she seemed to be going for the hammy sweetness she thought her role required and when the comedy part of the film was over and she had hot pants for graham , there was no spark on the screen to give the affair any life . it all seemed manufactured , leaving the film telling its joke to an audience they believe will be sympathetic . the problem with that is , the one-note joke ran dry a long time ago . i just couldn't wait for the film to end . if you are going to make a campy b movie , then it takes more than crudeness and over-the-top performances to make it funny . i'll take my campy film with no pretenses to art . . . let it be a film that is bitingly hilarious ( ok , just funny will do ) . 
another pretentious film from the director lawrence kasdan ( the big chill/ silverado/ grand canyon/wyatt earp ) . i never saw a film of his that wasn't arty-farty . the film suffers from an interminable case of blandness and exhibits an unwillingness to go beyond its cute little tale to see the dangers of someone who invades another's personal privacy by pretending to be someone he isn't , especially in a critical field such as the mental health one . in other words , the film makes the assumption that anyone with sensitivity could be a psychologist . this film was so weak and misleading in purpose , its story so dry and unconvincing , that it was a chore to just watch it and not give up on its arrogant attitude . it seemed to get stuck on itself and had no movement for the longest period of time . the film also makes no attempt to show anything about mumford's character or his inner being , except by telling the mere biographical data a tv news report might tell about someone arrested as an impostor . mumford remains as bland and unknown by the film's conclusion as he was throughout the film . this is stupidity glorified beyond a point of belief . there was nothing this film had to say that made any sense , and to top it off , there was no comedy in its attempt to be a screwball comedy . frank capra used to make social films like this in the '30s and '40s , but those goody-goody themes have long been played out . if they weren't , they would still be making films like that . i found the last vignette particularly phony and disconcerting , since the film has the arrogance to say that her illness is merely psychological , which goes against most evidence of the disease and discredits those who suffer from this very real illness , as they know that its physical nature is very serious , and their treatment requires a competent medical doctor seeing them , not a quack . there was nothing fantastic about this fantasy film , not even the fantasy . it was a film that tried to make you feel good about your problems and tried to show how they would go away if you can just get someone to listen to you : anyone . it was meant to be a likable film like elevator music is meant to be not upsetting , as a sort of universal music of acceptance . in both cases the effort wasn't worth it , by trying to be so bland it had more of a negative effect than if it was trying to say something worthwhile . this was a film made up of phony characters , whose problems were surface deep and were covered in the most superficial of ways . it was hard for me not to see this film as an excuse to justify doing something that is criminal and then explaining that it is ok , look at all those who were helped . if we followed the film's logic , then it would be ok for someone to pretend to be a surgeon , as long as he operated successfully . 
the director has gone after style and has thrown substance out the window , as the film follows this war of words as it escalates into an ugly scene of macho posturing and then into gore . the film was a clear imitation of a hong kong action film . the protagonists were three unlikable snobs , concerned with their image , talking about name-brand products as if someone was an idiot who didn't adhere to their tastes , and getting into the tussle because they were loudly attacking the other table for being tacky . this unoriginal film has nothing to say about these faceless executives or their counterpoints , who up the dissing into physical violence . zippo is one of those villains who just can't seem to die ( i suppose he's supernatural ! ) . shundo ohkawa's direction is meant to be glossy , high-tech , but suffers from being amateurish and outdated , overrun with trick camera shots to capture the violence . the director's color scheme was nightmarish and depressing , some scenes were smothered in metallic blue shadings . the film was about as uninspiring as reading gq . the only fun in the film , was in the opening scene , watching the two tables trade smart-alecky digs at each other , other than that this film was as much fun as watching someone get hit over the head with a bottle . 
a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . it was an insult to one's intelligence . i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven . 
nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film . it's just a pile of dreck . . . an ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . " end of days " aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . it's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a big-budget slasher film . the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . . . . accordingly , you just put a " 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get " 1999 . '' with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult . this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film . i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose . 
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . ' there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral . wayne wang's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey . so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing . 
chocolat by lasse hallstrom is a thoroughly manipulative and indigestible art-house , comedy-drama , fluff film . every character is a clich ? , everything about the story is predictably smug . it is so easy to make fun of the one-dimensional villains and feel morally superior to them . i grew nauseous from how bourgeois this film was in attitude , where even the rebels are merely lovers of sweet things . i found not much about the film that i enjoyed ( though the cinematography was beguilling and the cast was adept ) . it was a labor just to sit through it and not gag , while waiting for the inevitable preachy sermon that comes at the end , so even the church is redeemed for its unchristian attitude toward strangers . lasse hallstrom has come down a few pegs after his more engaging recent films " my life as a dog " and " the cider house rules , " as he couldn't pull this fairy tale off without being tainted by the mediocrity of it all . this film got nominated for an oscar as best picture , which should show you what kind of films hollywood falls in love with . this contrived turn-around was just too much for me to digest without getting sick from all the sugar i was taking in . 
this one's a dry turkey . it has a good idea for a suspense thriller , but it is poorly scripted and executed . this fine ensemble cast is stuck in an unwieldy production , where characters have a lost look in their eyes . it's no wonder , they must realize that all they have to look forward to in this film is a contrived ending . the film sets for itself some lofty themes -- destiny , fate , mortality -- which are never fully explored with any depth , as the story describes the lives of some toronto citizens 12 hours before a bloody shooting spree in a trendy coffee shop . the film opens showing one version of the shootout in the coffee shop but in its concluding version , it shows the same shootout but with different results . the film's strategy is to show how one can change their plans and either avert a catastrophe or run right into it , which is hardly a fresh premise . but if done right , this film could have been worth the effort , even if many films have done the same theme before . all this movie does , is play with time and structure in too obvious a way , and because the plot is so heavy-handed , there are no chills in it . 
in this less than routine thriller , the cops and a philanthropist are the bad guys . it adds nothing to the situation . every character was one-dimensional , the story line was crass , the directing was more suited for a tv show than a feature film , the acting was stiff , and the cinematography was unimaginative . i can't think of one thing i liked about the film . 
this is one of the dumbest films i have ever seen . garland is one stupid lady in this film . the two things that are positive about the film are : beverly garland is a looker and the film is an oddity . but this film is only for beverly garland fans , which i count myself as an unofficial member . 
there's slim pickings in this shamelessly contrived melodrama built around a wal-mart setting . all the contrived sitcom scenes just never click . it's a film about a vulnerable , low-class , and stupid woman , but a woman who is good-hearted . the result is a predictably boring film which neatly ties up all the loose ends by its conclusion , whose heart lies where the schmaltz is . the film appears to be one big advertisement for the giant department store and its generosity to its trailer park clientele . novalee will almost blow her chance of real love , by thinking she's not smart enough for forney . but , wouldn't you know it , there's a happy ending , as novalee finally makes a smart decision and marries forney . this is a film that got itself stuck inside wal-mart and could never get out of aisle 5 . director williams , he once directed the roseanne tv show , uses the material adapted from billie letts' best-selling novel to keep everything as dumb as he can . 
and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . rating : * 1/2 |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13 
susan granger's review of " the musketeer " ( universal pictures ) hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts . as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . mena suvari , so impressive in " american beauty , " seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the musketeer " is a cinematic but shallow 3 . not this time 'round . 
this is a movie made for those who enjoy bad films . it's an exploitation teen movie with no redeeming social or entertainment value . it also fails to deliver any messages , to raise social consciousness , or to succeed as an artistic film . it's just a badly scripted and acted film , that by being so terrible might provide a few chuckles for the discrete viewer who likes looking through trash . the film ends sugarcoated with false piety and some idiotic questions are asked about the kids ; such as , where will the kids go ? the only question i had , was why make a film like this ? this film was as real as a snowball in hell . 
one of the most obnoxious sci-fi films ever . it offers hollywood's silly response to the 1950s red scare sweeping the country and promoted by the mccarthy senate hearings looking for commies under every bed cover . to realize how dumb this cold war film is , try this summation of the plot on for size : can it be that the martians are signaling earth and that their leader is that actually uttering the very word of god ? warning : spoilers are throughout review . this is one of those really bad propaganda films that has no entertainment value , as it shows how paranoic this country can be and how it can use religion at the drop of a radio signal to promote materialism and christianity as a superior way of life than communism . this one might be the strangest and most twisted red menace films of all time . the last message heard from mars is an abbreviated one ( thank god ) : " ye have done well my good . . . " then there is just silence . don't ask me to explain how all of a sudden ninety percent of the world workforce would lose their jobs and there would be a run on the banks because of this message . but that's exactly what this filmmaker is asking us to believe . but just when things look bleak for the free world , a spiritual message comes delivered on a different frequency . it's christ's " sermon on the mount . " this red scare movie is made for zombies from another planet , or witch hunters who want to justify how their dirty work is necessary . it's a classic in a negative sense , a must see for those who can't believe how a bad film can really be bad . 
his life is a dreary , loveless mess . this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo , where we see crime , ugly buildings , the subway , and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country . the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off , everything he touches he fouls up , a complete loser-- there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy . his comic effect , is a deadpan expression , that absorbs all criticism that comes his way . what is funny , is the way he looks at us , as he looks at the camera , showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature , emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up . but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that , it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story , a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film , we can no longer be content to relax , laughing at this inept mailman , we have to now see how he handles himself under fire , while the director , also , tries to bring romance into the story . as far as i am concerned , the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story , and it becomes a different film , where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful , with the buffoon-like georg menacing roy . roy is now the subject of a film that doesn't know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn , or just as a plain comedy . roy still acts with the same deadpan expression , as a result , everything becomes muddled and ridiculous . the laugh situations seem forced , the romance absurd , and the suspense unreal . at best , i found this film to be a modest effort at comedy , that results in a modest film , barely being less than annoying , but redeemed by showing me the darker side of oslo , a side that i have not seen before on screen . so i think that this first time director , who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story , and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable , and a story line that is very thin , has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film , but by the end of the film , wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy . 
wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . 
she doesn't love me . but even these words don't make sense , as we find out soon afterwards , that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other . it ends up looking not quite like a john cassavetes independent film should look . it seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story . as a result , the film suffers from incohesiveness , but because of the caliber of actors involved , they make a cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a cassavetes sandwich , even if there is not much real cassavetes in the sandwich . in other words , the story just wasn't there , it didn't seem to be original , and this from a script by the real mccoy of indie films , is astonishing , to say the least , even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of the graduate . the film , however , managed to be entertaining . it just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about . nothing was resolved or could be fully understood . for example , it made no sense to think that eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didn't know that he was there for a decade not for three months . too many other things about the movie were either murky or didn't add up , unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable . what worked for me , was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta , it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns . i also thought that gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen . he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor . without them , this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience . 
this rambling , marathon of an epic movie , aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer , erupting for a few electrifying scenes , and going on for what seemed an eternity , to tell the 50 years of yugoslavian history by dividing it into 3 parts : the german invasion in 1941 , the cold war-tito socialist state period , and the ethnic cleansing and war period in 1991 . the best scenes are the ones that featured the brass band , used from the opening invasion scene , where we see the band march raucously over the ruined landscape , for no particular reason , and then is used intermittingly throughout the film . it woke me from my snooze each time , and gave life to a film that needed resuscitation . a film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals , which i understand to be political jibes , but i still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny . the most memorable scene here , is the zoo being bombed by the nazis and the animals running free , which is example of another too obvious piece of symbolism . all the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over , along with the filmmaker's yearning for a unified country , this is done an unnecessary amount of times , until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme . what saved this film from bombing out completely , was the excellent technical skills of the director and the robust performances from the two male leads , and because this part of the world is in the news again with its problems that draws us into their civil wars , having started the century with its ethnic conflicts and will end the century with its problems still not resolved . other than that , i couldn't wait for the film to end . 
their romance is believable as long as the story remained in scotland . this is all trite and , for me , unlikely stuff . therefore the animated george of the first half of the film , is reduced to being a passive tourist , everyone showing him a thing or two about their country , and the film flounders , caught between a soft romance and a soft political treatise , accomplishing neither one very successfully . george does the sensible thing for a highly emotional person to do , he splits from here and heads for glasgow , supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the contras are by his unexpected adventure . i expect that he'll really have something to say in the pubs when he gets back home , where he belongs . it really wasn't that bad of a film , it was just too flat and preachy . but it was pleasant to watch oyanka cabezas , she was quite innocently alluring , giving her role an authentic tone to it , as there were moments when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say , and that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause . but in the end , the film never managed to be all that convincing , probably because it sold its product too hard . and that is unfortunate , because i didn't learn anything new about the nicaraguan political situation that i didn't know before . everything seemed too pat , more like a stanley kramer liberal political film than a former ken loach politically independent film , such as his land and freedom . 
well , this cure might work on film , and who knows , this information might have some medical merit that i am not aware of , but as part of the plot , stefan as the healer , ingratiating himself with the composer to break his musical silence and give it all for the world of music , started to give me a headache , as it reminded me of all the formula films of this nature that i have sat through in the past , thinking that this easily could have been the theme of a sports film or a multitude of other films , and that the splendid idea that opened the picture was about to be destroyed by contrivance and implausibility . o great muses , where are you when the filmmaker needed you most ! the moral of the story centers around whether you believe one's self-sacrifice for the good of the world is a genuine and necessary one , or that unfilled desires are the height of all deceits . these and other interesting questions could have been delved into , if the plot wasn't so ludicrous , and if the film wasn't so uninspired , as to make it almost unbearable to stomach . tis a pity ! 
the first problem i have with this film , is why this title , since there is not one single thing about this film that pertains to the myth of jesus . i understand the title comes curiously enough from a philologist , ernest renan , whose idea of christianity was the basis of the script . but this inarticulate film failed to convey any religious feeling , and therefore it made no sense to keep that misleading title . the " life of fred " would have been a more appropriate and less insulting title . dumont shot this film almost like a straight documentary , using lots of close-ups on the youngsters , with long stretches of nothing much happening on the screen , cinema verite style , except the annoying sound of motorbikes racing through town , as it traces the life and lives of a troubled bunch of youngsters , with nothing to do but ride their bikes , play chicken with passing cars , hurl racist slurs , and pay no heed to what is happening in the world , as they cannot fit into society , and are angry at their state of being . though it should be pointed these are not criminal kids , just the regular garden variety of locals . it is a film where nothing happens , but boredom is rampant , where a sentence of dialogue makes us pick up our ears , as if something is being said that must be heard and we don't want to miss it . but we soon learn that nothing that is said is meaningful . these youngsters are not likable or approachable , even watching them on film is chilling , as they are so unmoving , that it is easy for the mind to wander and think what a waste of time this is , what's the point , one can get gloomy just by watching these misfits hang around doing nothing . in the end , there is just a feeling of impotence here , that there is a major problem out there in society and there does not seem to be one single answer to solve it . this is the kind of film you might see once and you get all that you possibly can from it , as it is hauntingly told , but there is no point in seeing it again . it is such an ugly story , and since it would have been more suited to be a documentary than a feature movie , as it offered no drama or enjoyment in the viewing of it . it was more fit to be a primer for the ills of society put under the microscope , and how aimless a young man can be , and uncommunicative , that he so easily loses the one person who could have held him in check . if this film was trying to be told from a christian perspective , that what these kids needed was religion and moral values , then it certainly did not make its case . there are just no answers here for what happened that can make sense . 
in this kidpic , which is a very safe movie to make in today's iran , as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead , and a more liberal regime in its place , there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story , because of strict censorship , and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in , is in a type of film like this one , where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system , as everything is seen through the children's eyes . the only thing , is that i couldn't pick up any subtle attacks against the regime . maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up , or maybe there was no dissensions , this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film . the story is guileless . it is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers , which if it was an american film and didn't give me a chance to see a country such as iran , which i am unfamiliar with , but curious to see how it looks under this new regime , i would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was . but because it is iran and i am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there , i am more tolerant of its flaws than i ordinarily would be . why he doesn't tell his teacher about this problem , i don't understand , especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man , and , since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor . but , then again , if he did that , that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film , in the first place . if this film was made in the states , its theme could be , the ny state lottery theme , " you gotta be in it to win it . " during the race , the filmmaker pulls out a bagful of cinematography tricks and borrowed shots from other directors to make the race an exciting one , but a race that left me unimpressed with what kind of point the filmmaker was making . if one , could summarize , how this feel good iranian version of that old hollywood standard formula works here , tugging at the audiences' heartstrings every chance it can get , as quickly as tears fall from ali's wide oval eyes and a frown covers zahra , as whenever bad news comes her way , which is most of the time , we see a frown appear on her . i assume , what the film is trying to say , is see how you must solve your problems on your own , don't blame it on the government . i guess the point being made here is , both girls can be generous and have learned how to live with their poverty . the father's poverty reflects the director's own background , which is why the family is so touchingly portrayed but in such a manipulative manner , that it fails to be as convincing a portrayal as it could have been , if done in a more free flowing form . the father is seen as a true believer , never questioning authority , deeming everything to be in the hands of god , whereas his religious beliefs are so strong , he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the mosque to have for his tea . this display of moral rectitude , reveals how simple things can be if you just have faith and perseverance to endure life's hardships . is this what the film is really trying to say ? but as an impactful film , it falls on its face with a thud , unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children , where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine : rich people are not bad they can be nice , schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating , religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary , being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world , and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding . 
this very ordinary story is related in soap opera style , evoking heart tugging sympathy for the victim . how could you not feel sorry for her ? the steven rogers's script adds a bit of conflict to the story by having the mother-daughter relationship be strained . that took care of that little conflict . at this point of the film , i was hoping for some comedy or music to break out , like someone singing : matchmaker , matchmaker , make me a match . . . this film just couldn't move me with this familiar storyline ; its purpose was to try and get me so misty eyed for these two nice people who can't find romance together . but by the film's conclusion , there is the predictable happy ending , with the virtues of a nuclear family back in tack . i guess this is ok , because you really can't root against them , and the way this film was slowly moving along , with lots of wasted artistic shots of the small-town that had no impact on the story ; at least , it satisfied an audience who would appreciate seeing such a clean-cut and prosaic romance . it was truely a woman's picture . the nicest thing about this film was that it made for pleasant viewing . there was nothing to really get upset about . sandra bullock is very pretty and very nice . and then one day i looked and i was gone . " that is also commendable . the problem with all this , is that these topics are very similar to the real life situations of many americans , but this film adds no new insights to the problems or any kind of humanity to it . it just ends on an uninspired happy note . it , therefore , was unable to rise to the emotional level needed to sustain a sense of drama . the result is : that there is nothing special about this film to recommend it , nor is there anything particularly horrid about it to urge you to avoid it . 
this wasn't a bad film , as much as it was a mediocre one . it is taken from a paper thin story by the renown pulp writer of the vox populi , john grisham ( the screenplay is credited to al hayes , but rumored to have been re-written by robert altman ) . it was directed with misdirection by the legendary director robert altman ( m * a * s * h ( 69 ) , mccabe & mrs . miller ( 71 ) , the long goodbye ( 73 ) , nashville ( 75 ) ) , who has never directed a thriller quite like this one before , and shows with this film that his enormous talent , probably , does not lie with this genre . the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete bust is the marvelously energetic cast . they took this inane formula story seriously and did a fine job in keeping it going . branagh might be a capable british shakespearian actor , but he has a tendency to chew up his scenes , which he does here , to the further detriment of the film . that altman did such a haphazard job in directing this thriller , is proven in the first fifteen minutes of the movie , when he gives away the plot by anxiously holding his attention too long on an obvious set-up situation . as a result , with all the tension taken out of the film , in the very beginning of it , the only reason for seeing the rest of the film has become dissolved into watching how well the actors could work without a well-developed story . when the best part of the movie for me , is watching the hurricane take place , and i know that the weather conditions has little to do with the story , except as setting a mood , then i'm certain that i haven't been swept away by this film . there was , as far as i could tell , no particular character development of the principal players , no intense drama taking place , no new insights into the judicial system , or compassion felt for any one remotely connected with this story . i found myself trying to figure out why there is such a huge market for grisham's stories , and it sure beats me . . . the film becomes an actor's studio venture , with the following characters acting out their supporting roles with varying degrees of effectiveness : clyde pell ( robert downey jr . ) appears to be the most likable one in the film , playing a fun-loving alcoholic private dick and buddy of magruder . they all make an earnest contribution to a film that would have served altman better if it wasn't so thin a story he was telling . 
this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . 
it is difficult to fall in love with a material thing like a violin , except when it is played as beautifully as it is by solo violinist joshua bell , as esa-pekka salonen conducts the london philharmonia orchestra , playing john corigliano's score . its ill-conceived plot is so sloppily directed and trite , that it was a very trying experience just to try and figure out what the director was trying to say about the violin that made him think that this story was so mysterious and worth telling . each century is a primer for relating the current society's love for classical music compared to the love shown for it by the violin's creator . all the vignettes involving the violin changing hands in different countries made me cringe with embarrassment , as the tales were so devoid of any logic and so ridden with cliches , as to make them unintentionally laughable . what could this team of writer and director have been thinking about ? it is hard to believe that this is the same team that made the very pertinent and inspiring " thirty two short films about glenn gould . " the scenes in shanghai during mao tse-tung's cultural revolution , in which western culture is demonized and its books and musical instruments are unceremoniously tossed into a bonfire , are flatly and uninspiringly done . vignette left no lasting impression on me , except as a further illustration of how the story got the costumes right but distorted the historical events . that the film has lost all track of itself in these tedious vignettes , so much so that it has no chance of ever uncovering what it probably wanted to show , of how the universal message of music brings harmony to the world and how it transcends all cultures and kinds of people . if that was all he did , it would have been enough and perhaps the film could have ended with some dignity , and the music presented would have left a big enough impression so that the film could at least be worth seeing for that . but no ! for some unfathomable reason , we are supposed to get worked up about a bidding war for the violin and who would possess this perfect instrument when for the entire film there was not one person in the movie covered in enough depth that we could get emotionally involved with , and to care at this late date about who owns this material object , when it has long since been viewed as a mere trophy , just doesn't make sense . that the one who does walk away with the trophy , confirms my feeling that every judgment the director and writer made about this film was a wrong one . what makes this film seem worse than the usual hollywood blockbuster , a film that it is most imitative of , is that it is presented as a high-brow art film and will draw its audience from those who see such films , but it is done so pretentiously , lacking in any kind of subtle mannerisms and humor , that all it has to offer story wise is its superficial dialogue and pretty costumes . its high production costs to attain accuracy of story only resulted in a film of kitsch art . if you see it , it should be only for the wonderful solo violin of joshua bell . 
one thing becomes apparent , wenders has very little feel for comedy , all his efforts to evoke buster keaton type comedic skits fall flat . the film rambles pointlessly on-- and when he catches up with bauchau , these scenes of dialogue get pretentious , as if they were trying to say something heavy about images and the making of movies , but are really saying very little . the travelogue tour of lisbon , a city that is easy to look at because of its beautiful colors and tranquil streets , should come as no surprise , since this commercial film was sponsored by the city , as a way of boosting tourism . wenders contrasts the splendid structures of the old city with the more modern lisbon , not taking sides which one he likes better . the great portugese filmmaker manoel de oliveira makes a cameo to deliver a sermon on films , asking , " what use is the universe ? " a profound question for this lightweight travelogue to probe , as this conversation seems forced , not happening with the mood of the film ; nevertheless , some good ideas about the values of the older films are discussed here , the main point being that we need artists so that they can imitate god . i just didn't see much of a story in this somewhat diverting travelogue about lisbon , that would compel me to find this semi-documentary as anything but a mildly interesting travelogue . 
for three quarters of the film , an exciting , somewhat plausible thriller takes place , that is even occasionally intriguing . then it comes apart and turns into routine hollywood , cop-out stuff . as a result , this film wastes splendid acting jobs by clint , ed , and scott . it is no mystery to the audience , because they saw exactly what happened . it is watchable hokum , with a hardly credible story , getting by solely on solid acting jobs from the leads . the script calls for no bold statements about the politics of the white house , which makes the film rather weak in scope and purpose . yet , the film is bearable , fortunate to be in the hands of someone as deft as clint ; or else , with a lesser director , it could have certainly sunk to an abysmally lower level , though one wouldn't be far wrong thinking it has already sunk to that level . 
this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . now , that's a smart kid . maybe that's for another film down the road . this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . and that family of his , they're too good for words . yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . 
celebrity is like an amalgam of old woody allen materials , which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot . this fluff film ( no pretense at ingmar bergman depths here ) could have been funny but it isn't , except in brief spots . as far as being insightful about the " horses arses " who are into being celebrities without any other accomplishments to their credit , there's not really too much to be said that could be profound about that subject matter , it is obvious how shallow a fate just being a celebrity is . woody makes a stronger statement in the film's subplot that deals with love , as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck . here kenneth branagh is not woody allen , but he plays woody and it doesn't work out that well . he's just not funny , all he's got down pat are woody's voice inflections and neurotic gestures . it's as if he is a robot who looks the part but can't really be the part because he is isn't humanly programed that way . if woody played that scene , it most probably would have been funny , but with branaugh , it seemed pathetically flat and unfunny . donald trump is buying st . patrick's cathedral and tearing-it-down for a skyscraper . celebrities give trite comments to banal questions , such as , " what do you think of the rain ? " " it's really something ! " the beautifully shot b/w film ends as it begins , as a plane passes overhead with the skywriting word " help ! " this was a film that had no idea how to put this story together , it seemed so lifeless and flat , indeed , in need of help . for starters , none of the main characters were cast right , and especially branaugh : there's no way , no matter how exact his mimicry of woody is , that he can be thought of as a neurotic , nebbish , nyc jew . what was needed was some originality and some energy into making the characters appear absurdly funny and not carbon copy imitations of how celebrities are . the few jokes in the film were far and few between , and could not overcome the tired feeling emanating from the rambling story . woody is slipping , his last few films have been heading on a steady downward path . 
joseph ruben ( sleeping with the enemy/the stepfather/gorp/the good son ) has directed a lot of films that are just plain awful , as you could see from those mentioned above , except for the adequately made swte . he directed this predictable drama with a heavy hand as it lapses into melodramatics after a very emotionally moving start and after presenting a most interesting premise ; it is just too bad that the script had no conviction to follow through on its premise . the weakness of the film can be found in the director's lack of courage in understanding what a decision like this really entails to the person involved , and by making the film all about the anne heche character instead of focusing mainly on the two boys , as the film loses its sense of direction . by adding sidebars to the simple premise , it changes the question considerably and takes the edge off what decision is made . the director spoon feeds the answer that he thinks the audience wants , and it all seems to be a predictable formula driven film instead of one filled with a raw energy . after mid-film , any logical attempt at soul searching for what to do was lost in a series of obvious contrivances and clich ? s that were displeasing to watch . bad directors do such things to good ideas . heche is intense and persistent , not letting up on the less than eager sheriff to make such a commitment . here the story gets side-tracked for bad reasons . the only scene that made sense from this point on in the story , was the one where tony's fianc ? e ( vera ) asks some intelligent questions of the lawyer and fails to illicit responses that would make me want to go back . who in their right mind would unquestionably believe what beth is saying ? that is too easy a reason . heroes usually don't know if they are going to be heroes , they just do what is right at the moment . it is instinctual . in this case , from what i have seen of beth's direct confrontational approach , as difficult as it might be to say no , i think most people in tony's shoes would have no choice but refuse her request . at least , it does for tony . the scene of lewis in the malaysian jail , which is actually a jail cell in the philadelphia prison system , of him rambling on incoherently , complaining about the cell being godless , i thought , more than being good acting , smacked of melodrama and was not a very convincing portrayal of someone going over the edge ; but , it was scary . i just wonder how many would honestly go back to save lewis if they were in tony's shoes or in sheriff's shoes . i also wonder how good this film could have been in the hands of a fritz lang or even an elia kazan , or a modern director such as a martin scorsese . and that is the shame of this somber picture , it failed to move me and seemed to turn into a slight story , and this is after all its contrivances . 
passion ( director/writer : jean-luc godard ; cinematographer : raoul coutard ; cast : isabelle huppert ( isabelle ) , hanna schygulla ( hanna ) , michel piccoli ( michel ) , jerzy radziwilowicz ( jerzy ) , 1982-fr . ) i have never warmed up to godard films ; i always found them pretentious and only mildly diverting . i have not seen a film of his since the '70s that i particularly cared for . so i looked at passion , a film about his love of politics , art , and filmmaking with a slightly jaundiced eye , and i was not disappointed . i still don't like his style , or his rejection of a linear story for a rambling dialogue that misses more often than it hits the mark . what i thought he did exceedingly well in this work , was have the cinematography for the film within a film , enhance in a very elegant manner the film's costumed and mannered scenes , allowing them to shine as colorful spectacles , and by making good use of the actual paintings by incorporating them into the film , using such artist's works as , el greco , rembrandt , rubens , delacroix , and ingres . the story in a nutshell is about a polish director trying to make a film on a shoestring budget , while courting the elusive isabelle huppert and the plain-spoken hannah schygulla , and fighting with the producers who want the film to have a logical story . godard has made a film about searching for something to love by showing that love is something that is essential to keep you in balance amid the chaos of one's life and the outside turmoils of war and class struggle . hannah says , in a moment of deep reflection , " sometimes i love what i don't like . " ummm ! an intriguing and provocative thought by godard , though i am not exactly sure what he means . but it is thoughts like this , that make me keep coming back to see godard films . for me , there is only one basic rule for the cinema , make an intellectually sound , honestly done and lucid film . i think i'm on a collision course with messier godard , though his ideas on making a film , such as passion , and my ideas , will sometimes result in only near collisions . i admittedly find some of his premises provoking , which is why this film , has enough intellectual stimulation in it for me not to loathe it , just to feel unsatisfied by all its unfulfilled promise . 
a second-rate , watchable noir film , distinguished by its gritty authentic nyc location shots and the lack of acting ability exhibited by this largely unknown cast and the low-level crime committed , where the detective jokes that this crime didn't even make it into " the daily news . " he doesn't seem like he is an actor or a cop , but he does appear as if he is a genuinely nice person , which in the long run might prove better for humanity , but it doesn't help this film , a film that could have used something more from him to spark this ordinary tv-like crime drama . why he goes on this rampage is never made clear , except it is surmised that he might be the jealous type . spotted by our hero , he shoots it out with him unsuccessfully among the many gravestones , which makes for a colorful scene , the best and most memorable one of the film . 
a screwball comedy that is conceptually funny but the more ridiculous it gets as the story picks up its pace the less funny it seems . it never has an edge to it , therefore it seems more like a sitcom than a comedy/drama . drama and characterization are thrown out the window , and contrivances rule the day . . . which allow the home fries to become too tasteless to enjoy . but the film just can't get above the absurdity of its bizarre tale to say much more about why everyone is so screwed up or make the romance between the shy dorian ( the good brother ) and sally feel like it belongs in the film . these two are not believable as lovers , as i saw no sparks flying from them . also the murder plot is just not that funny , and when it becomes more involved , it just becomes a sick joke that goes on for too long ; and , the film ends with a one-too many helicopter scene that couldn't be more ridiculous . the film had all the hints of going somewhere in its opening premise , but it seemed to get stuck , not knowing how to tell a story about what the film really should have been about , the quest of dorian and sally for a normal life despite their dysfunctional up-bringing . being a weirdo does not make one necessarily an interesting character . that is a lesson that this first-time director should take away from this failed effort at dark humor . it should be mentioned that there was one appetizing scene in the movie , as dorian escorts sally to lamaze class and we see them go through those exercises ; it is still a good scene even if it is still not clear why he does so . i just had the feeling he felt sorry for her , rather than that he was in love with her , as i presume the director wanted us to believe . this is a film that might please those who frequent fast-food places and don't worry about their cholestral count and indigestion . in other words , the film moved along at a fast pace , there wasn't much to think about , and might be just the thing for those who would consider this a date movie and not be concerned that it didn't deliver a heavier meal . as for me , i try to eat junk food only when i'm stuck on the road and am starving to death . in this case , since i wasn't stuck on the road , my excuse for eating this junk food was that i was enticed to try something new they were advertising on the menu , but after tasting it , i felt it was just like the same old stuff they always serve in those places , and i just wasn't hungry enough to appreciate that . 
obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville , except in a sitcom . pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it comes to nostalgia , of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family , of the resistance to change , and clashes between those in the film who become " colored " and those who remain in " black-and-white , " and about the need to be an individual and not conform . it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection . the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging . through special effects from digital processing , flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modern-day " alice in wonderland " look to it . j . t . there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this " cute " idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society . there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would have ; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films that were critical of society : but a list of such films would be very extensive ( marty , high noon , ace in the hole , etc . ) . this snooty attitude , looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly " hip " new age bothered me . afterall , my impression of this film , is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s " feel good " type of sitcom , and nothing more . it is basically , a gimmicky film , which is the only new ground it breaks , selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present , but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present . the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in . i just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film . character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness , a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience . what is offered movie-wise , is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems , which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today . therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture , trying to be cute , letting the baby boomers know that it's okay , there're doing just fine . you can keep being materialists , just be cool about it ! there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future , instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies , which means it's just another escape film , unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up . 
this very predictable social drama will have every character be a walking clich ? , every major event be a contrived one , and it will do everything it could do to convince the audience that assimilation is the way to go , but get out on the pulpit and preach against racial hatred . it is good to have such tolerant beliefs , don't get me wrong , but to make such a boring and muddled picture about it , is not a good thing . the film's themes about religious fanatics , family problems , prostitution , hypocrisy , jealousy over a friend's success , the immigration problem , bigotry , the problems a young man has in growing up , a father-son frictional relationship , social hierarchy , male abuse towards women , the tribulations of a workaholic , love , loneliness , the need for warmth , and cultural clashes , are just too many themes for one film to have . the filmmaker is all over the cricket field with these problems , but just can't make this long list of problems have any lasting interest for the film goer . and , as if these weren't enough problems , some more come up when the taxi driver takes as his fare , a german industrialist , stellan skarsg ? rd , who goes by the name of schitz ( you can see for yourself what goes for humor here , as you try to pronounce that name ) . when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of things , this uncompelling film can't make up its mind on how it stands on some of the major issues it brings to the table . by the film's end i don't know how to feel about parvez's romance with the prostitute , as it certainly breaks up his family life but gives him a temporary renewed self-respect and hope . for me , it was just an unbelievable scene , and to boot , it didn't clear up anything about the mainstream moslem official position on the negativity toward prostitution . in fact , i didn't learn anything about moslems except to see them as the stereotypes they are most of the time depicted as in most other mainstream films . om puri ( in custody/city of joy/target ) is an accomplished actor from india , whose trademark face and ability to be very expressive and exuberant , engages the film with his sense of what it is to be a decent person . there is something about him that identifies with those who are outsiders , as long as they are not fanatics or troublemakers . but the filmmaker doesn't even attempt to play fair , the story is told totally from his point of view , all the others around him are one-dimensional characters , who are not only uninteresting but they are for the most part made to appear annoying . that parvez is a decent guy , with a good attitude , is probably not as true as the filmmaker thinks . that this film doesn't have the power to say anything important that hasn't been heard many times before , is my take on it . but the worst thing about this film , is that it is a snoozer , not able to make its story about the virtues of being faithful to your culture and your wife come to life , as it is mired down in one clich ? after another . the best thing to say about this art- house type of film , is that it should upset no one : it is so bland and unexciting that it is hard to tell what all the fuss is about . there was just nothing here to get worked up about . i just assume people immigrate to western countries to earn a better living , there is no big deal in exposing that . but , you can be sure of one thing , this moslem filmmaker did not pull a salman rushdie with this film . 
by the title of the film , you know that betrayal is part of the storyline ; and , it is , in this hip attempt at neo-noir and a quentin tarantino type of film , using the colorful city of new orleans as background for its murder and kidnapping tale . as a nervous accountant from dyson's firm , the one who will hand over the ransom money to the kidnapers goes through the phone drill of where to drop the money off , the cops follow along and have some forced conversations on the way to stir up some humor in this poorly characterized and acted script , that will rely on trick plots and a series of betrayals to tell its very forgetable story . one of the cop conversations mimics many of the more recent neo-noir genre films in slickness , as hawkins is reading jim thompson's crime novel " the killer inside me , " which he has already read and greatly admires , with the main thrust from that conversation being that the book says there is only one plot in a murder mystery and that nothing is what it seems . there was nothing fresh about the plot . the characters ranged from being obnoxious to being miscast , though if one wished to , a case could be made that carla gugino exuded some charm and sex appeal into the film . there was some inventiveness in all the plot twists , but the effort wasn't worth it . the storyline and plot twists could not hold up to scrutiny , anyway . somehow this film , for the first time director , managed to have some entertainment value in its glossy feel and arduous attempt to keep one guessing at what will happen next , that is , if you weren't turned off by then by how hip it tried to be , as it was a little too cool for its own good , and the story suffered because there was no meaning to what was happening : it all seemed like a pointless exercise . 
it worked reasonably well for part of the film , as dead bodies came popping up unexpectedly in this sleepy montana town , but then the story ran out of tricks and everything about the film fell apart and the psychopathic woman hating slasher , lester long ( vaughn ) , became a tiresome charge , his maniacal charm just wore out his welcome on screen , and the film's conclusion lacked tension or purpose and seemed to be a wasted effort , as it just simply ran out of gas after about an hour into it . what garofalo brought to the film at this point , was some welcomed comic relief , much needed because this film was exhausted from all the contrivances and lack of adequate character study it provided . it was only through garofolo's sense of black comedy , that the film was still bearable ; and , at that , it was only barely bearable . clay is somewhat of an innocent , at least , as far as the murders go , but he certainly can't be commended for being a truthful person . everything gets resolved in the film's anticlimax , that mercifully ends in an arrest , though some 30 minutes too late , as far as i'm concerned . what might be likable about this film , to viewers not that discerning about plot or character study , is that this film was user friendly and brought about a hearty guffaw or two . none of the actors was bad , bad , but none were memorable . it's one of those films that is easily forgotten . 
larry buchanan has created this cheapie aip color film that has a great title , a dismal story and hammy acting worthy of an amateur thespian production . it's the kind of film played out in a serious manner , that you couldn't help either enjoying or hating it for its awkwardness and how bad it was . my caveat is : if you don't take this film seriously , you are more than likely to have a better reaction to it than those who do . the martians observe that ties are worn here , something they discarded in mars 50-years ago as something useless . that's about as deep a jab at political satire this film takes . love is something that has gone out of vogue in mars for the last 100- years , but our hero says , this is what it must feel like . she never realized he was a martian , which shows you that even experts on mars could be fooled . what goes for special effects , are scenes where women are disappearing and aliens are appearing out of thin air . if you are in the mood for something to see that is inane , a film that edward wood jr . would be proud of , but in the hands of an edgar ullmer , could have been much more notable , then this one could hit your funny bone . in any case , i was in a silly mood when i saw it and was not disappointed , it was as bad as i thought it would be ; and , i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the semi-autobiographical novel of george orwell . there's a point to be made in this 1930s depression satire about money counting for everything , and this point is hammered into every aspect of the story , until it gets to be not only redundant , but outright irritating to hear . the story quickly makes its point , as valid as it might be in orwell's novel , here it seems trivial , that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldn't be doing , when they would be much happier being accepted into the middle-class where they duly belong . it's a fair enough point made , but the story has this nasty habit of being saccharine to a point , where its sugary qualities could be fatal to the viewer's heart . even the scenes of poverty are sugar-coated , making everything look so awfully nice . something gordon can't do . it also , somehow , stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in common , cynically stating there is little difference between how they achieve their ends . the message i got , as i watched this tepid middle-brow , so-called art film , is that living in poverty can be stifling , and that kind of life is not what makes an artist . for a movie railing against accepting bourgeoisie values - it instead becomes a movie that ends up glorifying those values . its final message is that there is no escape from one's destiny . if one looked hard enough , there can be found some wit in gordon's portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary . but this uninspired script cannot find anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful . you'll get a better feel of what orwell was trying to satirize reading that book than you will by seeing this film . 
this is an excellent example of a classic bad movie coming out of the '50s sci-fi genre , one that is funny without intending to be funny . this little subplot never gets resolved , but adds to the confusion of the story . the story was so confusing , that the film could have been seen in any of the following ways : as a typical teen dating flick , a sci-fi movie , or a comedy spoof of the horror genre . cahn raises no serious questions about anything- he seems to have a money and brain outage when he made this one . he could have certainly used a much tighter script , better actors , and had more imagination . somehow , i got a few laughs out of this flick , and that's good enough for a film that can never go out of style because it is so bad that it never was in style in the first place . . . this film was originally released on a double bill with " i was a teenage werewolf . " 
edward l . cahn's four skulls is a rather humorless and flat horror story , but it's blessed with a wonderful title . you would think her old man would tell her about something as important as that . challenging idea was never really followed through , as the film instead became a conventional melodrama . but in the hands of someone more intellectually capable than cahn , there was the thread of a good story available , instead of shooting for the mundane , the reliance on the creepiness of the killer and the spectacle of seeing a head shrunk to tell the story . it is what gives one immortality . don't ask me what this means symbolically ! it's too bad this film didn't have some more life to it . the best thing that can be said about it , is that it was competently made and was somehow watchable . the actors are to be commiserated with and not criticized , no actor could have done anything with the dry lines they were handed . it was never mentioned if they were twins or not . 
there is a level of flatness to the film , as it is not aided by its feeble dialogue and uninteresting special effects , its incredulous tale , and unexciting tone . but all seems gloomy , because if they can't be stopped here , they will surely go on and attack the mainland . this was just not a good sci-fi film , but i've seen worse , much worse , and somehow or other , this hammer film was watchable , but barely so . this film should be liked most by fans of either christopher lee or peter cushing , who will most likely appreciate lee's stylized performance . 
lies become the theme of the film , as it is examined how harmless or necessary they are for people , especially since most people live hum-drum lives and could use a little imagination to liven things up . people also lie because they feel hurt about things and think that by lying they can make themselves feel better . the spanish director , bigas luna ( jamon , jamon/golden balls/the tit and the moon ) , known to make very unconventional and sexually implicit films , has apparently toned down his act here , shooting for satire as his only proverbial fish in the barrel to shoot at . not only did i find this film a bore , the acting uninspiring , and the motif unconvincing , but what annoyed me most , was that there was scene after scene of horty telling his inane story of his dying love for marie , to an audience that pays to hear this so they can have a good cry over it . it seemed to be pushing in the audience face what the director was supposedly satirizing . the film is a parody of a need people have to hear great stories , whether they are true or not , which might be a good idea on which to anchor a film , but this one had no heart-beat to it . the melodramatic soapy romantic story , just never sailed gracefully across the ocean . the film was never able to be poetic or articulate about the point it was trying to make , instead it just settled for looking good , but couldn't rejuvenate through this feeble storytelling ploy , the art of good storytelling . there was just no passion to be found in all these handsome stars ; the idea of the film , that one can't live without imagination in one's life , was a worthy idea that never fully materialized . it has the look of one of those arty-farty films , the ones that only play in art houses and pretend to be something more arty than what they are . 
story is predictable , likable , and soapy . it leaves one all fuzzy and cuddly inside , as the film uses risque material to make its point , yet it is almost totally devoid of hot sex . it traps you in its formula mode ; you can't help wishing these blokes do well . the film's popularity does not surprise me , people seem to like quick solutions to their problems and films where thinking is not a prerequisite for enjoying it . i have a feeling that this film will age poorly , and like a lot of trendy films , will not look good a few years from now . i thought it offered just so-so entertainment value . it never gave me the impression that i was seeing something that mattered . the full monty as promised , was not even delivered . 
cost of living is a modern noir film that does not use the familiar plot devices of that genre as it usually is used , instead devoting the entire film to studying one character and her reactions to being on the run . it is the type of role usually played by a man . the film might be about trying to find oneself , or about why you are going to a fishing village if you're not interested in fishing . the most profound line said by anyone in the film is said by edie falco : " things are not always what they seem- ben ! " the dialogue is muted . the film yearns to be a story about how impossible it is to be free in today's world and how everything one does hurts . it's different in mood and scope than the usual type of introspective film . the film hinges on falco's performance . i didn't buy it , so i failed to find the film engrossing . she seemed to be acting too hard to look as if she was loose and free . at the end of the film , we don't know too much more about her than we did at the beginning of the film . if you are looking for possible plusses in this hip neo-noir film , it might be in the director's visualizations . at least , this indie is original and is not the usual rip off you see of late . it should also be noted that i had trouble reading the opening credits . they were unclear on the video i watched . but what remained more unclear to me , was what this film was about . it was not a paricularly pleasant film to watch , and the violence in it , seemed misplaced . i had no feel for those in the film , therefore seeing the violence was much like reading a newspaper account of a tragedy occurring to strangers . 
it's a one joke movie that quickly runs out of steam , as the cloying humor soon becomes insipid and the comic situation turns out to be more ridiculous than funny . it's a star vehicle effort , so if you like de niro and crystal , then you have a chance of falling for the film's silly premise and not caring how inane the dialogue is . the shrink is absolutely frightened of vitti and wants no part of it , which is a source for much of the film's early humor . >from here on the story has no place to go but downhill , the jokes quickly fade , and the pacing of the film drags . the film is loaded with sight gags , clashes of culture between the educated jewish doctor and the tough-guy italians . there are many mafia type of jokes , stereotypes of italian gangsters , and many other routines about the mob that have been seen in a host of other mob films . the scene wasn't funny , believable , or watchable . i don't think the director knew how to end this satire with any credibility . the film just ran out of one-liners and ways to be irreverent to the mob , the f . b . i . , and the psychoanalysts . the jokes might even seem funnier late at night . the film just wasn't involving enough to work as drama , but if it's a few laughs that you are after , then this film delivers . de niro has a good eye for parody and is the best thing about the film . crystal seems to be miscast . viterelli and kudrow add light touches of comedy in their supporting roles . the funniest bit , i thought , was of de niro crying over a television commercial , thinking it was so much like his real-life situation . 
the trouble with carlyle's part ( not his performance ) was that it had no punch to it , he couldn't make it an interesting role . the stories he told about the english bringing fleas and the damp to ireland , didn't evoke the comedy or sympathy for him that it should have . the whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery and poverty , as the family will undergo a series of hardships , including the loss of three young children . the film never gets untracked from its maudlin attitude . it suffers from the old problem of trying to portray misery without having a film that can escape from being miserable itself . the other problem is that the misery seemed unreal , everything about it seemed so uninvolving and pristine . the film was flat . it was hard to care about what was happening to them , except the obvious reaction one gets when seeing a poor household . their endless plight seemed no different from the beginning of the film to the end . it was the filmmakers job , the director alan parker , along with the screenwriter , laura jones , to make me want to care , but instead , they made me feel too distant to honestly feel anything . and if misery per se were an interesting topic , this adaptation of frank mccourt's book might be too . to make matters even worse , this is an excrutiatingly long film , over two-and-a-half-hour running time , and it seemed to go on forever . this almost solemn film portrayal , with an irish brogue voiceover throughout its entirety , explaining every little piece of misery as if were a work of sublime art , did not work for me . the film has a bored look about it , indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross events and that frank , as a survivor , will somehow come through all this misery . it almost seems to be a shame not to connect with the family's plight , but as well-intentioned as this film was and as good as the pulitzer prize winning autobiography was supposed to be ( i didn't read it ) , it was , nevertheless , made into a conventional film with nothing in it to really rave about . most life stories do not make for good dramatics in films anyway , they seem better suited for the printed page . this one is no exception . 
it is turturro's love message to the theater . this play-within-a-film , much like bullets over broadway or shakespeare in love , but not up to both of those film's achievements , nevertheless it manages to develop a somewhat pleasing storyline and some amusing comic moments . it is flawed by its uneven drama and how easy it is to lose track of what is going on because of all the characters the story tries to portray . the second memorable performer is umberto bevalaqua ( walken ) , the detested theater critic , who plays the part of a fop , excessively showing his outrageous mannerisms . the scene works as farce , and it gives the story some needed life . when walken is onscreen the film has movement and excitement , when he's not , the film just doesn't hold up as well . life in the theater gets juxtaposed within the film ; its story going back and forth with contrasting details , such as the latest gossip or romance , the vanity of the players , and the strange love they have for the theater . their romance outside the play mirrors their romance in the film , and one can therefore imply that it mirrors their real life romance . she easily handles this charming but not too difficult role . aida turturro , the real-life cousin of the director , plays a part that makes good use of her huge breasts . the play and the film was overloaded with a flavor of italian , it only seemed odd that the film was staged in new york and not in milan . i can't see a general audience taking to this strictly for the theater crowd film ; it is made mostly for those who love to know what goes on behind the scenes and those who are theater buffs . i applaud the effort and the originality of the film ; but , as for what resulted , i was not overjoyed with this overstuffed production . 
the best part of the film , is that it did capture the east village feel of the reagan 1980s . but , for the most part , this was a dull film that had nothing to say and soon wore out its welcome as the story became insipid and the characters grating . in the end , the film proved to be as shallow as the characters were . director risa bramon garcia , making her debut after a successful career as a casting director , seems to be more interested in getting the pop music of the 1980s heard and the bizarre dress of party goers viewed , than in telling a cohesive story . in this ensemble piece , there are far too many characters to really get to know them and too many sub plot developments to keep your interest . everyone fades in and out of the scene , for no rhyme or reason , each with some tale to tell . " if you relax , you can get what you want , even if you smell like dog shit . " the film is almost bearable when it just goes for the look and feel of the times , but when it tries to pontificate , such as when it sums up the film by comparing relationships to the way smokers have a need for cigarettes , and asks the question from the pair that got the most screen time , rudd and love , " why are people so scared of each other ? then i felt the party was really over and this mtv produced story faded out with not one interesting character in the film . i bet you a dollar to a donut , that you could have gone to most any other new year's eve party in manhattan and met more interesting people ! 
john frankenheimer was once recognized as a quality filmmaker capable of making great paranoid thrillers ( the manchurian candidate ) , who has slipped off the precipice of reliability and is now reduced to making this nonsensical , exploitive actioner , that has a bleak metallic snowy look to it . it is made as if to bypass movie houses and go straight to video rentals . it is made from a mindless script . no director , cinematographer , or actor could have made this into a credible film ( well ! replacing affleck as the lead couldn't have hurt in immediately improving it . the film's only purpose seems to be to come up with as many ludicrous plot twists as possible and see if any one in the audience can guess how it will work itself out . the violence is gratuitous and in the last 20 minutes or so , the story proves itself to be an insulting one . the characters became gradually less and less human as the twists kept piling up . the shame of this film , is that it was oddly enough entertaining for long stretches , as it seemed to pass for being a diverting actioner , until it reached the point of no return in tolerability . to say that this film had holes in the script and that everything about the story could be challenged , goes without saying . but things only get more contrived the further along the story moves , so better to forget all the contrivances to the story and try to enjoy the film as is , and take this b- film for what it is . this little ploy will go on for the remainder of the film , as rudy is sometimes nick and sometimes he's just plain rudy . if you think you have seen the main twists , let me warn you , that's just the beginning of all the surprises . the more of them there are , the less sense the film seems to make . john frankenheimer moves the action along at breakneck speed but the more the characters try explaining the ever-changing situations , the more ridiculous the explanations become . then the film tries to pull a complete 360 degree reversal and end on a note of christmas cheer , since i think this is supposed to be some kind of christmas story . what disturbed me more than anything else about the film , which includes its senseless violence and its need for an obligatory nude shot of theron , was the audacity to try and clean up the mess it made , by relating the film's finale to the holiday spirit of giving . it seems to want to spread its desperate gloom over everything it can touch . the thing this film mostly gave me , was a sense of astonishment that frankenheimer , who could still in flashes shoot a scene that is mesmerizing ( the one on the cracked ice with affleck jumping into the chilly water to save theron ) and then follow it up with one that is so dopey ( machine-gunning warfare in a casino that looks like a supermarket ) , that you wonder what happened to the director in a career that spanned 44- years . what compelled him to make such a dumb film as this one ! 
the mild attempt , in this b- film , to be a convincing noir film , never materializes , as the film looks more like a sophomoric attempt to imitate the genre than the real thing . there is no feeling for characters or intensity in this story , it looks contrived from the get-go . all the characters , except for reese's , are slime balls , people we could care less about . so when this film moves into its different plot twists and all kinds of ludicrous situations develop , it wanes in interest , as the characters were never developed and the film has a cheesy look to it . it seems to have the style of a thriller but without the substance . its attempt at humor alluded me . 
a superficial b- movie about flying saucers , offering no relevant views on matters of space exploration , except some might be amused to see washington d . c . come under attack by flying saucers . using ray harryhausen's flying saucers , this film becomes mostly a special effect experience . it is a good example of the kind of mediocre , paranoiac sci-fi films that were being made at the time . though , the exception to this uninteresting sci-fi film at the time , might be the one adapted from robert heinlein's novel " rocketship galileo , " which was made as " destination moon ( 50 ) . " but it wasn't until kubrick came along in the 1960s with his " 2001 : a space odyssey " that sci-fi films matured into solid ventures and started to be taken seriously . the silliness of the film is delightfully highlighted by the finale of the flying saucer attack on washington dc . its use was argued against , by major huglin , that it would only destroy our country and might not even work against the aliens . the film becomes a classic in sci-fi for its special effects , despite how mundane everything else about this project is . 
a somewhat tolerable golem b- movie thanks to fast-paced direction and a compact script . recommended for only die-hard fans of edward l . cahn . it is a remake of " the mummy ( 32 ) " and was on a double bill with the same director's better made film , " it ! we are told that there were some mysteries from those days that still remain today . flash back to modern times and a workman on an archeological dig unearths a jewel box and the mummified body of a faceless man . meanwhile the bronze medallion found in the jewel box is examined along with its inscription : " whoever stands between me and what's mine shall perish . i am the son of the etruscan gods , quintillus . " if you buy this explanation , maybe i can interest you in some swampland in florida ! i bet you this jaded policeman thought he saw everything ! this is enough to make that swell derby he wears , spin around atop his puzzled head . if you don't believe that is the ending , see the ending for yourself . the filmmaker plays it straight , but if you are in the mood for some balderdash , i am sure there are some laughs to be gotten . 
swindle , the ( rien ne va plus ) ( director/writer : claude chabrol ; cinematographer : eduardo serra ; editor : monique fardoulis ; cast : isabelle huppert ( betty ) , michel serrault ( victor ) , francois cluzet ( maurice ) , jean-francois balmer ( monsieur k ) , jackie berroyer ( chatillon ) , 1997-france ) this is one of chabrol's poorer films , the fiftieth one for the 68-year-old french director . it has the look and script of a b-film ( even though it was written expressly for the two stars ) . chabrol is playful here , but his lifetime of running gags against the bourgeoisie and his attempt to make this a giddy film , just didn't hold up . but it was never clearly spelled out what their intimate relationship was , as chabrol likes to keep one guessing . it wouldn't surprise me if they were related that way . maurice is scheduled to bring the money to guadeloupe to be exchanged , and chabrol adroitly uses all his many years of filmmaking skills to show double-crosses and switches of bags , and how things can go violently wrong with even the best of schemes . but , it is mostly a story about the two characters , their needs and how they relate to each other . that forms most of the wry comedy . there is also interest as to how and if the swindle can be pulled off by the couple , who , at times , have not told the other what they are up to . this caper story seemed stale to me , even though it has a certain amount of charm . but it did not splash across the screen with verve and audacity as much as chabrol intended it to . the director seemed to try too hard to relive his past with many allusions to characters and inside jokes from his many films , with the old master pulling out his tricks of the trade from a hat with too much ease to be believable . 
costa-gavras ( z/missing ) presents a film about the media exploiting the news and expects us to be surprised to find out that all they care about is the ratings . the big carnival did this theme better , as long ago as 1951 . the film is one-dimensional in scope , no one has room to grow . the amusing relationship between travolta and dustin captures our attention for most of the film , but nothing interesting happens . the world of the media is shown to be worse than ever , as this new breed of executives are not really news people . the actors tried too hard to make something out of nothing . in the end , it is an old news story that we got-- but this time it is manipulated by the movie director instead of the anchor man and the new corporate executives . 
the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of " snow white " , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling . 
unfortunately , in this ridiculous remake , the two films are only the same in name only ; though , in the broad sense they are both about a three thousand year egyptian curse . this mummy put me into a petulant adolescent mind-set , as i found myself madly screaming for more script , more story , more tomes , after seeing this stinker and found that i could only calm my rage by going to the video tape of the original mummy and seeing again for myself how richly quaint that film actually was . this is a film that lives for the clich ? , even relishes in it , flaunting it as the reason the film was made in the first place . it is so much like those thrashy " b " films in the early 1950s i saw on a saturday matinee , where the theater was so noisy the elderly matrons who were the ushers looked like they were having conniptions , as they marched down the aisles with their flashlights shining on the children with loudmouths . those were the " good old days , " when you got to see two pictures like this for the price of one , and didn't give a hoot how raucous the theater crowd was , and how dumb and unbelievable the hero was . this film is a return to that dumbness , only this time its appeal is targeted for a more mature crowd and the price of the movie ticket has skyrocketed . this is a children's serial adventure thriller , the indiana jones kind but without that film's charismatic actors . so wouldn't you know it , his tomb is opened inadvertently by some ugly american tourists . rick is one cool guy , with a self-deprecating sense of humor , with an unflappable personality , and with one eye for beauty and the other for battle : in other words , a man's man . the heroine tells us that this lackey is so wormy a character that he will surely get his come-uppance by the time the film ends . other so-called delights in this special effect and overlong film , are the gibberish messages read from the holy books , the one-liners coming off the lips of the characters faster than the bullets from their blazing guns , and all the free-spirited action scenes , that are non-stop , giving the film a lighter than lighthearted look to it . excuse me , for not finding this nonsense film funny or even entertaining ! after seeing mummies becoming undead and rising from the sand and enough gruesome killings to last me a few milleniums , all i can say is , mummies ! 
this film is tied together by four tired soap opera tales , that are competently-crafted but predictable . in my humble opinion , this film could have been made by using only one of the stories , instead of making them into roughly four- 40 minute segments , each with a title flashed on the screen to indicate the start of the new story . it is hard to believe that this film won more awards than any other mexican film ever has ! it makes you wonder about the quality of film that didn't win an award . it happens just like that ! it is the usual tear-jerker fare seen on those afternoon soap operas on american tv . on the plus side , the stories are intricately woven together so that they make sense . there is much humor in the telling of the stories and the acting is decent . otherwise , this plays mostly as glorified soap opera , with few surprises in all of its lengthy presentation . 
you see , this mr . perfect turns out to be a madman . he exhibits signs of being a control freak , someone who might even be a nut case , by taking everything so literal and acting in a robotic and deliberate fashion when he speaks , so that everything he does seems out of place . in fact , the acting in the film by everyone is really fine , especially considering how thin the script was . it is the story itself and the way it is directed that leads to the detriment of the film , allowing it to have the look of one of those films made only to be seen as a rental video , which indeed is how this film was released . the film tries to play like noir , but only ends up being the kind of fake noir that is more irritating than complimentary . it tries to be purposefully evasive about its storyline and to have its tenuous story be based on chance as being the sole determinant of life . what it eventually becomes is a predictable psycho flick and not an unpredictable noir film , as it wanted to be . it has trapped itself into being a film without a plot , with rotten dialogue , and a fake means of maintaining tension . it tries so hard to give itself a weird angle through its characterizations , which only work on a superficial level-from the neurotic damsel-in-peril , plummer- to the split personality performance of forster , whose actions waiver between maniacally calm reasoning to histrionic schmaltz , as he goes off the deep end reciting rhymes . the main problem , which the film is never able to overcome , is that the storyline is not that compelling and that the characters are not necessarily interesting even if they are quirky . the story never had a real strength to it ; it always seemed like the actors were play-acting , that the script was struggling to device another gimmick to go with the coin toss motif , instead of letting the story seem to come about out of its own accord . this did not help explore anything going on inside the characters , only trivializing the story further , making it rely solely on a gimmick to tell its story . what we are left with is a series of encounters among characters who are not that appealing in the first place , and also by the end of the film , we know only a little more about the psychopath than we did from the opening scene . i therefore wasn't sure what the director wanted to accomplish , except he probably thought by showing how idiosyncratic all the characters could be , that would be enough to get it over . if that was what he was thinking , he misjudged the quality of the film , but not before he showed flashes of talent here and there , for example , in the opening scene in the desert --- forster's calm demeanor was played-off beautifully against plummer's nervous energy , and with the desert lurking as a hostile backdrop to the action , it added a thrilling surreal sense of dramatics to the story . but the film fell too quickly into the serial-killer mode , and lost the edge it never had but always wanted . 
high fidelity ( director : stephen frears ; screenwriters : d . v . this wormy role is one that he has been seemingly typecast for in most of his films to date . his narcissistic performance totally grossed-me out , even though i liked a few things about this feel-good , quirky movie , but whose plot could have been better explored if it was discovered what the plot was and whose story would have been given more credence if it had a sharper script , a better sense of pacing , and less screen time for the annoying cusack character . cusack spent nearly ninety percent of the film's time looking right at the camera and explaining to the audience what he was thinking and doing , as if the story was made for an einstein-type and needed to be decifered to the under-thirty something audience targeted to see this film . rob is griping to the camera about his failures in romance , and in imitation of the david letterman's tv show shtick of making lists to elicit laughs from the audience , rob is prone to making top 5 lists , having recently completed his " top 5 all-time breakups " , going through those he most clearly recalls , giving the audience a running narration on each of those romances . by gosh , what is this fine comedic actress doing in this film , and to the bargain , taking such a miniscule part ! laura ( iben hjejle-a danish actress making her american debut ) is the best thing about this film . her lips are of a succulent ruby red color , and when she pouts or a small smile comes over her , there is a very sensuous crease that comes over her mouth and chin area-- plus she has a nice laugh and cries in a dignified manner when she has to . what the film does well , is capture the nostalgia and musty atmosphere of a place where music geeks hang-out , memorizing tunes and reciting them back-and-forth to each other , as if they were idiot savants who overdosed on sugar . he's a van morrison clone without the singer's voice or forebearance or manners . the clerks' attitude toward the customers was brusque , but the exchanges that resulted were very dear . in keeping with the spirit of the film , i made a top 5 list of things i liked about the film and a more involved top 5 list of things that i didn't like about the film . first what i liked : 1 . the soundtrack kicked ass . 2 . the two musical geek clerks were funnier than batman and robin in hell . i didn't have to pronounce iben hjejle's name to know what i liked about her . 4 . lisa bonet made up for her inconsequential part and gratuitous sex scene by adding a beautiful song to the film and a warm presence to a story that wasn't that hot to begin with . i can count on my left hand how many films were made about geek music-store clerks who work in musical stores that are not in a mall . what i didn't like : 1 . john cusack is either a putz or someone who is acting like a putz , but in either case , i can't handle watching a needlessly long film ( over two hours ) such as this one , with someone as self-absorbed as he is , without getting a headache . 2 . the story seemed to be a never-ending one , where there were at least three times that i thought the movie had wound down and was about to conclude . instead , the movie got a second wind and added more banal storyline to keep it going . it seemed to be poorly edited and written with a few different endings in mind and failed to make its rewrites seamless . the result is a very shoddy film , even if it is adapted from a popular cult comic novel of the same name written by nick hornsby . the film has not been improved by changing the setting from london to chicago , and as far as i'm concerned , it could have been set in mars or venus , with the same results gleaned . the love angle was predictable and wimpy . but this was formula sitcom stuff all the way , as all three music geeks got some reward for their long-suffering for the art of nostalgia and trivia and useless knowledge . 4 . for a movie that is about growing up , maturing , and handling relationships , somehow the characters didn't particularly make me interested in how any of their relationships were resolved . i felt used by this film . and i had to listen to him kvetch for the entire film and i'm not even a psychoanalyst who gets paid to hear such dribble but a long-suffering movie critic who was bored to death by this very forgettable pop culture movie and couldn't wait for the session ( uh ! movie ) to end . 
it's a post-war baroque melodrama , creaky as wooden steps in an old mildewed house might be . it's from the german ? migr ? director , john brahm , who gives this genre a decidedly european flavor . " the locket " has something to say about a person with a severe personality disorder needing the proper psychological therapy . it was too wooden a presentation to generate anything but a few sparks . but the way of telling the story by flashbacks within flashbacks , from the view of the male lovers who were deceived by the pert heroine , nancy blair ( laraine day ) , is visually unconventional , and the story itself , is cleverly diverting . this was one role that was not suited for his temperament . it's one of the few performances i thought he was awful in . this action disappoints nancy . as an added bit of melodramatics , blair cracked up over this and was institutionalized , and only recently was released . it's a somber story , with a lot of heavy-handed things going on . the plot devices were too leaden to be fully credible , but the complexities of the heroine's character were well presented . the analyst's comments about her stealing to get even with mrs . willis , seemed to be a reasonable explanation , if taken on face value . but that doesn't answer her ability to murder or her depraved indifference to men while pretending to like them . the locket only had some glitter but not enough substance to make its aims lucidly felt . though , as muddled as it was , it still kept me alert , wanting to know what gives . the problem is , that i never found out what gives . 
a far-fetched and schmaltzy hollywood-style mainstream tale about time travel . to buy into this half-baked sci-fi wannabe , one has to have a suspension of disbelief and of all rational thought . if the catch-the-killer subplot had any real suspense to it , i might have bit more for this nonsense storyline . but that thriller part doesn't even hold up with your average tv detective show . but this story is unfortunately overtaken by its weak serial killer story . thereby , the film is reduced to overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth between past and future events , sloppily changing one for the other , until nothing made sense , since you have to keep changing both simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish that storyline with accurate details . the acting was surprisingly good , despite the poor script . dennis quaid is a throwback father -- one that many a child would gladly appreciate . if the film did one thing right , it showed a family that was really together and good to see on the screen , especially with all the recent films mostly showing only dysfunctional families . it was refreshing to see one for a change with a father as a good role model , even if some might find this relationship too corny . gregory hoblit ( primal fear/fallen ) has fallen into the trap of going overboard in his use of sentimentality , which overtakes the film and makes it too gooey for comfort . also , his directing suffers from an inability to tell a good detective story , even if his idea on time travel is intriguing . unfortunately , the time travel story does not hold up to any intelligent scrutiny . so what is left , is a movie that should find its own audience with those who find the father/son relationship meaningful and find the time travel concept to be entertaining . 
a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline . the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw .

a modern day comedy taking place in havana , cuba , that is laced with supernatural implications , as it is directed with artful flourishes by fernando perez . in the pulsating background , capturing the whimsical mood of those who live in havana , is the staccato music of bola de nieve and benny more . but the film suffers greatly in making every single thing that happens pertain to a heavy-handed metaphorical symbol . the hallucinatory story , as a result , is dumbed-down , so much so , that it loses whatever strength and vision it might have had . the film is heavy with quotes like that one , as if these cute little slogans can really explain life in cuba . the film lost its focus and painted an artificially whimsical picture of cuba , that was hardly relevant or enlightening . whatever pleaure there was in the film , came from its splendid ballet numbers , the beautiful artistic framing of its shots , and its bouncy music . but that was outweighed by how it was weighed down from its symbolism . 
it is a call for artistic freedom , but interestingly enough , this political film shies away from offering any significant political commentary . a performance artist eats a bar of soap with a knife and fork and is revolted by what he eats , almost as much as the audience is revolted by seeing him go through that routine . this was a hard scene to swallow as not being a contrived one and a very forced metaphor on the political situation , though it provided some much needed levity rather than any particular increase in political insights . the last 20 minutes of the film offers a surprise twist to the story and thereby saves it somewhat from the doldrums it was in . it results in a film that gets its message across that freedom is frozen in china , that things are still far from democratic . it was a though-provoking film , but in a very manipulative way , that was none too pleasing to view despite its good intentions . 
this girls' sitcom film is strictly fluff , with a few comical moments succeeding in a long line of misfires . the girls try so hard to be funny by making faces and doing slapstick , that it is a shame that the storytelling ability of the director is so poor , that it undermines the comedy . it is imitative of a dumb boys' film , with the same way of irritating you . to provide some nyc character atmosphere , we have the girls' landlord ( brennan ) demanding rent from the girls in a strident nyc accent . whatever that means , it was the funniest moment in a film that couldn't get to central park if it was standing on it . 
a vigorously played aip submarine b-film , with a no-name cast and low-budget special effects . all the enlisted men talk in an unnatural jargon , which is make-believe navy talk , that is sometimes irritating on the ol' cranium and at other times slightly amusing to the proletarian in me . this is basically a harmless ww11 war film that is watchable for insomniacs turning the tv dials late at night in search of something benign . it is one of those rare 1950s ww11 films where the japs are not even cursed out -- the men could have been fighting the greeks and no one would have known the difference . one of those 'gung ho' movies , where the only dissension comes from one of the officers who goes over-the-top in being too gung ho . i recommend this film for those who didn't like " the yellow submarine " but like any other submarine film which doesn't have a cast of rock singers . this is one of those films that has a simple plot and pads it with supposedly human interest stories , as it highlights one character from among the officers and one from the enlisted men . halsey's acting efforts nearly sabotaged the film , as his strained performance was just blah ! the film's purpose was to build tension for its action-packed climax , but by having an inferior complex because of the thinness of the story and the characters all being dullards , an effort was made instead to show how courageous the captain was and how he was , predictably , able to win the men over to his side . 
m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first " mission , " who is noted for doing " chinatown " -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . if i was only entertained by this . . . i could have lived with it . but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . 
a promising near-future , sci-fi adventure film , whose leaden direction , weak acting , and incredibly inadequate set designs , cause the good premise to collapse into an apocalyptic failure by the time the film was resolved . this film should have been entertaining , but instead felt tiresome . there was no fun to be had , no noteworthy dramatics , dialogue , or story developed . 
gregg araki ( the living end/totally f * * * ed up ) professes in the opening credits that this is a movie about heterosexuals , as opposed to his other films about queers . but that is really a dubious distinction , as the sex is mindless , violent , and bawdry . many of the visuals displayed homo-erotic actions , and the film is about as romantic as a stool sample . it is an offensive film , made to parody other hollywood teenager films , by taking digs at do-gooders , the moral majority , the right-wing , the fundamentalist religions , and pop culture . but the film is so vacuous and poorly thought out , that it comes off as strictly an in-your-face stylized film , without coming up to breathe fresh air or manage to say anything worthwhile . the parody seems so cold and distant , and it comes from lowlifes who have peanuts for brains , which makes their attempts at black comedy seem futile . it was difficult to be amused by a film that was so childish , its dialogue so banal , and its whole purpose tied to being shocking . the enjoyment from the film , for those who get their jollies from watching something that is this gross and sexually hideous , is the flaunting of morality and the depravity in the violence . xavier explains his tattoo of jesus on his dick , by telling amy , he put it there , so people could say , i've got jesus inside me . besides spewing out green slime and still talking , the severed head rolls on the floor . there is a running gag about 666 and about religious or do-gooder slogans in every store ; one store has this slogan --up with hope -- down with dope . i guess this is supposed to mean that these three have bad karma . after seeing all the mayhem , absorbing the teens in action , watching how retarded and alienated they are , the film felt as healthy as a diet of fast-food , crystal meth ( speed ) , and shotguns . it failed to show the l . a . underground kids it made as stars of the film , as anything but cartoon characters . in some perverse way , i would recommend this as a blind date movie in a drive-in , for those young guys who want to see how their dates will react to all the grossness onscreen . for others , who might be taken with teenager films , but in a healthier and more comical way , stick with someone committed to making bad films about teens , such as ray steckler . all his flicks are funnier than this one . 
" gun shy " puts in a lot of effort to be zanier than the other mobster comedy films it takes the same theme as , except here it is a lawman instead of a hood who is suffering from anxiety attacks and is in need of seeing a shrink . he has a chronic stomach problem , which is used as a running gag throughout . everything is played for laughs ; fidel and fulvio are cartoon figures , with the only difference being oliver platt is funny and jose zuniga is seen as either being psychotic or preening , but he's not funny . this is tv writer eric blakeney's debut feature as director-writer , and he gets mixed reviews . the comedy was mild , the script was choppy , and the story had an inane charm to it , but no more . the usually bland liam neeson had more of a flare for this type of farce than i thought he would have and platt , in his inimical style , got off a few good one-liners , such as " fun is overrated . " sandra bullock , whose acting career is spinning ever-downward , had a small role that only required she look good in that oversized shirt she likes to always wear . overall , the comedy was too slight , as was everything else about this film , to make it more than passable entertainment . its nearest relative in ganster comedy films is " analyze this " ( gun shy was made before that film ) , but this film didn't have de niro as its star , which made this film seem not as good , though it was on the same level . but , if you ask me to state confidentially , the worst thing one can say about this film , i would say that it suffered from too much flatulence . 
it is stiffly directed by philip haas ( angels and insects/the music of chance ) , whose wife belinda wrote the screenplay and was the film's editor . but , she is painted into such a silly corner in the romance , that the film never had a chance to do anything but pant heavily for close to two hours . this is a token of her patrician generosity , as she figures , this guy's a refugee running away from the nazis , i might as well give him something wonderful to remember for the rest of his life , so if he goes back to the concentration camp he , at least , will have some pleasant memories . the problem with this melodramatic scene , was that the acting was shrill and the outcome was hardly convincing . she mentions to flint that she slept with the violin player because " my heart was full of tenderness and pity . " to inject some comedy into this dull film , derek jacobi has a small part as a drag queen , offering mary his support . while anne bancroft shamelessly culls laughs for her performance as a gossip-mongering high-class slut , who has a contemptable attitude toward people . both performers chew the scenery . i found this stiff upper lip film to be ridiculous ; the acting and directing robotic . the film lacked tension , it was not erotic , and the story went out of its way not to make sense . the only thing about this movie that pleased me , was how it couldn't ruin the splendor of the beautiful florence countryside and its splendidly graceful edifices , as florence is lushly photographed in all its magnificence . 
a farcical political drama , done in the manner of a tv spoof . an ensemble cast carries off the comedy by making use of irony , as it shows in a clich ? d manner how the british are stand-offish and all the immigrants are earthy people . what it fails to do is tell a coherent story , as everything about this exaggerated tale is hopelessly lost in a sea of silliness . isn't that extraordinary ? " there was an attempt to show that besides speaking the same language and looking alike , the two feuding ethnic groups have a lot in common . this film , commissioned by the british film institute , and made for a budget of about 1 . 8 million dollars and shot in 35 days , is rife with rapid cuts and scenes that seem disjointed and unconnected , it just seems like an incomplete movie , and one that rubbed me the wrong way with its pat messages . but , i must say , it did win the prix un certain regard for best film at the 1999 cannes film festival . 
it is a poorly done remake of " them ! " , 
" tea with mussolini " is based on the semiautobiography of the film's director and co-screenwriter franco zeffirelli . these english expatriates feel very comfortable to be in italy , excited by the civilizing nature of all the art around them . because of her biting tongue , she is known as the i scorpioni , a name that unfairly sticks to this gaggle of english ladies , since lady hester seems to be the only one with acid on her tongue . lily tomlin is the american in the group , a bold lesbian archeologist , in a role that is inconsequential , she doesn't even have any funny lines , but she's always smiling , dressed in pants , and sunburned ( the reason for her being so happy , is that she is probably daydreaming about some of the better films she has been in ) . she has the most embarrassing line in the film , as she explains to luca why she remains in italy , " i have warmed both hands before the fires of michelangelo and botticelli . " lady hester sets the tone and proper standards for how this snooty group behaves . the film ends on a melodramatic note , and if this wasn't supposed to be a true story , it would be one that was hard to fathom . this was a ridiculous movie ; it was an apathetic sudser with flat dialogue , stiff characterizations , and if it didn't take place in florence , where art is a way of life , this film would be a feckless fiasco . it is hard to believe that luca is franco zeffirelli , he seemed so out of it , the role seemed to have nothing to say , as if he wasn't there when he was there , and his heroics as a 17-year-old with the resistance movement seemed unconvincing . also , the actor who played him , baird wallace , was very stiff and made his presence felt in a very awkward manner . since the film is supposedly about the director blossoming to become a great artist , i saw no evidence of this . this is a fourth-rate production . 
the film has no point to make but to emphasize that silly challenge , but , it at least softens its obnoxious attitude with an ending that is more satisfactory than what i expected from this shallow film . i can't see anyone but teenagers and , perhaps , hapless parents of teenagers , finding anything here of interest . though some adults might look back to those halcyon school days with an anxious leer and wish to recapture some pubescent memories of some shameful incident and to feel the nostalgia again through this movie . looking through the eyes of a lost adolescence is perhaps the only way to view this movie , a movie that makes sex into something that is implicitly evil . nevertheless , as awful as this gross-out film is , it will become a movie and video hit with its targeted youthful audience , following the footsteps of that other cheap thrill movie , " there's something about mary , " and because sex sells , other films like this one will unfortunately follow . the sexual awkwardness of the boys is exaggerated for comedic purposes , and the school looks as if it is around only as a stage for the teenager's rite-of-passage . everything in the film is used to get a laugh , but the film wasn't really funny , though its commercial success is due to the guilty laughs it evokes . for me , it was just a childishly gross and a sexually raunchy movie . but it smartly restrained itself and never pushed the envelope that step too far , staying well within the framework of how traditional sitcom comedy works . there were other gross-out scenes in a movie that had no edge , just embarrassing moments and vulgar gestures . if it weren't for all the grossness about sex and toilets , this would be a typical family-fare tv sitcom . the film sells itself through its sex scenes and then after exploiting every awkward sexual moment it possibly can from the teens , it reverses itself with a contrived moral ending to say that love is not forced and comes naturally , while those only interested in sex are creating unnecessary problems for themselves and putting undue pressure on themselves to be happy . his big deal , is that he can't say the four-lettered word love -- like , i love you vicky . the side players add to the gross-out gags . he is a particularly rich and obnoxious jock . a totally unnecessary scene , that was played without emotion or reason . the film's saving grace is the sound advice given about romance by the females . everything else about the film was just as gross as it appeared to be . the unimaginative comedy is of the lowest level , meant to titillate those in need of a teenage sexual massage . 
the screenplay was written by dorothy azner , who made it into a statement film about women being abused in a male-dominated society . the sympathetic jury comes in with a not guilty verdict . the film itself was unconvincing and too banal to strike a chord with me . it therefore doesn't surprise me , that , perhaps , gabrielle wasn't as nice a person as portrayed in the film . this film is worth a look only for historical reasons , to see how melodrama was done before there were talkies . 
there's nothing that isn't predictable about this sappy formula sob story and there's nothing about this flat romance between these two good-looking upper-middle-class yuppies that is endearing . it is a disappointing film , lacking imagination , turgidly acted , and laden with a mechanical script , a real downer after the director's more sweeping last film , " xiu-xiu : the sent down girl . " they haven't seen each other for some time , so i guess granny has a memory lapse of what she thinks of him , as for some inexplicable reason she helps get this romance started . it was unnecessary because this silly girl who loves to say wow , is dying to go out with him . he quickly gets her to bed , but honoring the old-fashioned conventions of films shot in the 1930s , we don't get to see any sex . the next morning the playboy deceptively tells her that he is too old for her , and then gives her his standard non-commitment speech , " all i'm able to offer you is this--what we have right now--until it ends . we have no future . " his job in the film is to say clich ? lines that reprimmand gere for being such a cad to women . i guess in the way this film looks at things , that would be a terrible retribution . gere can only tell her that he felt like having sex with her , it was no big deal . to pile on some more weepie scenes , winona keeps fainting and gere keeps trying to find a miracle to save her . since everything about this film is manipulative , the odds are 4 to 5 against her living , since this film is just as corny and as predictable as the 1970 film " love story . " this is basically an exterior movie , as manhattan is warmly photographed , but the interiors of the two lovers was never made to seem warm . the romance never rung true and the stars did not have a good chemistry together . gere seemed to be content to be in love with himself , always smugly smiling while everyone said how handsome he was , while ryder was too shrill to be engaging . at one point in their romance , ryder when in central park , waxes poetic and tells him , " i can smell the rain . " she then coos and makes a contorted face of pleasure , and with this trite dialogue and mushy call for love , amid the autumn splendor of the golden leaves beautifully photographed by changwei gu , we are asked to believe that these unreal lovers are for real . 
a showtime original movie that results in a very strained comedy/mystery story , one that is more stupid than offbeat and less noir than in the mode of a sophomoric film school work . it tries so hard to waver between reality and being completely off-the-wall , until it succumbs to being mostly annoying and far too cute looking for it to be appealing , yet not funny enough to be worth the effort of setting up such an inane story . i can only recommend it for those who want to see amanda plummer perform her magical acting ability as a psychic . she can do no wrong , no matter how rotten this made-for-tv film is or how ridiculous her part is , as she sticks out like a rose in a weed garden , plying her talents as a sex-craved psychic for the police . the wonder view apartments has a swimming pool that is polluted with slime and filled with debris and it has an assortment of odd and annoying tenants , from wise guy roller skaters to corny lovebirds . all the while , the story revolves around stan's study of psychology in the sterile college atmosphere , where rats are experimented in a maze to study human behavior , which is compared to how invigorating it is to study people's behavior in a real setting , as he finds people in this setting act the same way the rats behave in a maze . this might have been funny , if there was some credulity to their picking on the dumbfounded stan , who has an airtight alibi . but the film defeated itself by trying to be both real and absurd , thereby nothing caught fire , it all seemed like every man and woman was out for themselves to see if they can get a laugh somehow from a story that was going nowhere . the film failed doubly , both as a comedy and as a mystery . there were so many gaps in the story , that one can easily make a case that nothing made sense and what was funny , was merely only silly . this is a low point in storytelling , as the director has failed to keep this shallow film above even the low water mark it set for itself . 
another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . ummm ! 
there is some nasty action , lots of bad guy mafia men talking tough to good small town people kind of stuff , but the film was too dry to be anything but mediocre . 
michael dinner's geezer mobster comedy has a funny premise but falters on the execution part , as the yuks come , but not often enough to sustain the predictability and staleness about the film . the film tried hard to be funny and genial , but this idea for a film has been done too often in recent times to appear fresh . whatever went wrong , must be blamed on the poor direction and poor script . this film needed such an intensive voiceover like i need to have sand kicked in my face at the beach , it just ruined the flow of the story and prevented the story from being a movie experience rather than an exercise in trying to cover up the film's inability to tell a story . the film keeps adding on sub-plots and the comedy keeps getting stifled with the added weight of the new sub-plots . it isn't enough to make the four of them out to be mobsters , but they also must now be deemed as good guys , so the film goes to unneeded lengths to show how wonderful they are . the director had a barrage of proven comic material to work with , an able cast ( except for burt reynolds-he was terribly miscast ) , yet the film falls flat on its face . everything about it seemed like a mistaken pratfall . the comic timing was off , the story sagged , and the characters had nothing up their sleeves but old jokes and comedy routines that weren't even funny most of the time , ones that seemed out of place . with yuks like that , all i can say is " oy gevalt , " give me a break , get some fresh material already ! it might have been the funniest scene of the film , just to see their silly expressions as he leads them out a back door onto the street . i also left the theater by way of the rear door , and i also had a look of consternation on my face , wondering how easy it would have been to make this a much better film with just a little better effort in working the script . 
a comedy flavored by hippie nostalgia for the '60s . it has its moments of reliving the past before it turns into a silly and unimportant film , which could only say things that are clich ? s . before the film looses its grip on its subject matter and becomes too contrived and lightweight , as the opposing parties wind up on the same side -- it had some sparkling scenes with the hippie conversing with the stone-faced fbi man . this briefly encourages huey , because he is feeling down that no one remembers him anymore , disgusted that the hippies are a forgotten culture in the 1980s . at this point the film breaks down into the absurd and the comedy comes in dribbles instead of gushes , as the running gag over mistaken identity comes to a brutal end . by this time i was forgetting how much i enjoyed hopper's manic but egotistical performance and wanted the film to end before it lost all its appeal for those who were hippies back then . there's lots of '60s music in the background to remember the past , such as , dylan songs , hendrix and grace slick singing , and there is enough hippie memorabilia crammed into the story to give an aging hippie a temporary high . but the film itself , it was irrelevant . 
a mild thriller that has the glossy atmospheric look of a riveting horror film but not the impactful story to pull off this foolish sadistic killer tale in a reasonable manner , which results in one of the stupidest endings imaginable . it is a film that is done in the genre's formula mold , laying on all those mindless gory contrivances that horror fans have seen before , it is also a tale that has more holes in it than a new york city junkie . there is a twinkling of romance in their eyes , but he can't do anything about it because of his physical condition . the climactic romantic scene has amelia caressing his index finger -- which goes for love in this film . the best part of the movie was the chemistry between the two . it's just too bad that the film was so manipulative , dull-witted , spewing bad dialogue as easily as steam that oozes out of a broken steam pipe , as the whole venture just seemed absurd . he tells her some dribble about destiny , that destiny is what you make it -- if it's a gift you have for forensics , don't blow it . this dialogue is b movie material stuff , and that the stars talk this talk throughout the film , is a credit to them that they do it with straight faces . their faces have star quality written all over it and even though this role doesn't determine if she can act or not , it does show that her face , like his , shines like a star , as the movie camera is very kind to the two of them . the film builds up to its hokey conclusion by firstly misleading the audience who the killer is , then it has the killer confront and attack rhyme in a campy way , even biting him like a vampire in the neck . its appeal might be that it is so absurd , so lacking in tension and quality filmmaking , that one might be lulled into its state of languor and accept it for what it is : another horror movie in a long line of such films that should be a staple at the drive-in or as a movie rental for insomniacs who choose not to rent porno to get their cheap thrills . 
a poorly done documentary that is superficially entertaining , whose blurred camerawork , its failure to get hold of its subject in anything but a self-promoting manner , and its campy playing with the criminal scandals and lawsuits that became front-page news fraught with sex charges and fraud in fund-raising is done in a witless manner , which leaves me scratching my worldly head about why this farcical film was made or why it thinks this would make tammy faye , the subject of the film , look better than the national joke she is . the only thing this film clearly revealed about tammy faye , is that she loves to be in front of the camera , is terribly vain , is addicted to diet-coke , wears tons of makeup and wears her emotions on her sleeve , mistakeningly thinking she's an old-fashioned girl who likes real things when we clearly see otherwise ; and most importantly , she wears loreal mascara and has permanently false eyebrows ( which is her trademark ) , and that her lips are permanently lined . since i didn't care about her when she was riding high in the 1960s and 1970s and early 1980s , and i didn't care about her when she was banished from christian tv because of her disgrace , i wondered what this documentary would present that would change my mind about her , so i at least could care somewhat about her . but it failed to get me to see her in any other light than that of a self-absorbed publicity hound and someone who is superficial to the point of being a caricature of someone who is superficial , though if she is compared to those other christian hypocrites -- like her ex-husband jim bakker , jerry falwell , and pat robinson , she passes the likability test with flying colors . the film's aim seems to be nothing less than a rehabilitation project in the public image on tammy faye messner , the once queen of televangelism but the now exile in the world of christian televangelism . this reasoning on her part does not wash with me . rupaul charles does the narration , honing in solely on tammy's point of view . we don't know much more about jim bakker from this work , other than a few trivial crumbs of polished gloss tammy throws our way . i didn't buy into her act and i didn't find the film funny , when it should have been both a scream and a much more informative piece than what was presented . but if one has such low expections of tammy , as i surmise most do who are out of range of her choir , then some of those might find that she is more likable than they first thought . but don't include me as one her converts . i came away with the same trashy opinion of her i had before i saw this " mock " documentary . he might be right , i'm sure she'll even survive this movie about her . 
the provocative title tells it all , a pretentious satire on the negro myth of him being a stud to white ladies . the film is adapted from the novel by haitian author dany laferri ? re . the thin story never moves far away from its sophomoric attempt to shock and irritate a white male audience about its simplistic findings , but something that is certainly thought of in a very real way and taken to be a serious generalization by western society . to accomplish this parody , everyone in the film becomes a clich ? figure , with the main stud taking on every positive sexual myth of his prowess that he could about how good in bed the negro is . it seems this film will have you believe that every white girl in the film is dying to try out this sex god for themselves , and with the stud evoking what goes for a cool attitude , too willing to please one and all , the film becomes ridiculous in its banality without getting to how racist its theme is . the film by reducing everyone to being what their color of skin is , as it fails to get at truths that are more than skin-deep . this is film that fell in love with its generalizations and can't go further than that , even failing to draw comic relief from its stupid characterizations or making the protagonist anything but obnoxious and terribly vain . if the main character in a spicy spoof like this one , can't be likable , then the film has no chance of succeeding . it was a difficult film to just see this as a playful venture , which it should have been , but what made matters worse , was that it took itself seriously and tried to make a forced case about racial prejudice , using absurd scenes to try and show how white men feel inferior to the negro when it comes to sex and therefore will do anything to get back at the negro . i assume this film was trying to be funny , but its story was so full of generalizations that it was not possible to get by that and see people as they really are and not as stereotypes . this film probably does more harm to racial relations than it does good . it is a film that the kkk could easily agree with its findings , failing to see that the film was meant to be tongue-in-cheek . and that's the problem with the film , the satire had no power , as the film seemed more real than ironic . jacques w . beno ? t's french-canadian film is a dehumanizing experience , a film of missed opportunities to explore interracial realtionships , it is so dehumanizing that it doesn't even give the girls real names the stud has sex with , they are just given names like miz literature , miz tickle-tickle , miz redhead , and so on . outside of his sex , it is hard to find anything he does that is even remotelty interesting . that he wishes to be a writer and succeeds at it by the film's finale , typing as if he were banging on a drum , was hard to swallow . the only thing that was credible about the stud , was the enormous ego he had , it must have been as big as his . . . well , you know what i mean . 
it's possible for peter greeaway ( " drowning by numbers " / " a zed and two noughts " /``prospero's books'' ) to make a more boring sexual/erotic fantasy film , one that is more didactic and analytical , but not likely that he could duplicate one that is also so full of itself as this one was . it is the director's audacious opinion that he can get away without having a story to go with the full frontal nudity display of men and women he flaunts throughout the film . it results in a torturous viewing experience , as pablum is spouted in verbose spurts of emotive stagy responses , while the reward for the viewer is a few stilted visual delights and a few restrained chuckles to be had at the absurdity of all the perversity . the film defies social conventions and commercial filmmaking sensibilities , something greenaway has built a reputation on , as his films are critic-proof , playing to art-house audience types who relish his deft camerawork and the cerebral challenges his films pose as puzzlers . if so , what a left-handed honor is bestown on fellini ! the father's response to the film is , " how many film directors make films to satisfy their sexual fantasies ? " the son says -- " most of them . " which is about the best way of explaining what this very personal film means for greenaway . the film didn't mean much to me , but it did say something about how women understand sex better than men and men are such children when it comes to sex . it brought up things that are taboo and showed how art is a metaphor for one's obsessions in sex . the film felt so much like attending a tedious college lecture in a fellini 101 course in perversity as expounded by the arid professor greenaway , that it turned into an anti-erotic movie , a text book type of film where you can bring in all sorts of intellectual things that weren't developed in the film , but were only hinted at , and thereby there will always be something perceived about the film to justify it as an erstwhile effort . 
before hollywood got a hold of this theme , literature did . writers such as christopher marlowe , in his 16th century book on faust and goethe , writing about faust in the 18th century , used this theme . however , " bedazzled " is a remake of a more vulgar source for the faust legend , stanley donen's 1967 very funny satire , which starred ( and was written by ) peter cook and dudley moore . this " bedazzled " provides some lighthearted fun with the theme , but is not quite as wicked and not as funny . hurley gives this film its purpose and sense of tart humor , but even her role seems punchless and absurd . though , it is hard to understand why the geek wasn't more tuned into her and used one of the seven wishes granted to bag her instead of the rather ordinary frances . frances o'connor does an adequate job in a role that mainly requires her to be desirable in many different ways . she has a sweet smile and shows she can display a nifty tantrum , but compared to hurley's beauty and wit , she comes off second best in both categories and would not have been my first wish . all seven wishes are played out as comedy sketches , with some being terrible , filled with stereotype gags and dull-witted humor , such as the one where he becomes the witty author who is well-equipped but learns that he is gay ; some of them do have some spark , like the dumb giant n . b . a . the film uses the same actors who play fraser's unfriendly co- workers as comic characters in all the wish sketches , which adds a feeling of continuity , but it is played as if this material was more suited for a revue than a film . what this film lacked was a real sense of outrageousness , it seemed more like a benign tv comedy hour program than a satire that goes for something devilish . it painted too clean a picture of everyone . i think harold ramis could have come up with funnier and less obvious skits , there was a lot to play around with here that wasn't even attempted . the film went mostly for the physical humor of brendan fraser , who is no buster keaton and can't carry an entire film with his comic antics . the viewer watched him transform himself cleverly in each skit , but the film wasn't funny enough for it to sparkle that way , except in a few instances . i think when you make a remake , it should clearly be better than the other version or else it seems to me , there is no reason to make a remake . 
this is a pointless b- film actioner , a remake of the gritty 1971 british noir classic directed by mike hodges , which had the good fortune to have michael caine be the star and to have a story with an edge to it . this " get carter " features mindless violence , an incoherent and uninvolving story , and most unfortunately the humorless presence of the miscast stallone as a vegas mob enforcer , going to seattle for the funeral of his bartender brother he hasn't seen for a long time . he is dressed in a tacky bright blue suit , sports a goatee , and speaks in a low voice . it is filmed amid some dazzling night shots of las vegas casinos and shots of a rainy seattle , though the rain has no effect on stallone's suit , it never gets soaked no matter how much he exposes it to the elements . it's a clich ? movie . . . so predictable , that if you didn't want to see the way the sleazy bad guys were going to get payback for what they did , you could have left the theater and figured out which way this macho stylish film was going by yourself . you would have missed nothing , there is absolutely nothing interesting about this film . it seems that stephen kay has taken a perfectly taut original film , which was nasty and unremitting to the core , and made a mess of the remake by trying to clean it up , making it into a sleazy film , nevertheless , but one with no redeeming features . he tries to give the film a moment of acting , hugging his niece in a warm embrace , as behind her back he grimaces with obvious pain on his teary face , assuring the audience to pay little attention to this human gesture , they shouldn't worry , he hasn't gone soft , there's going to be a payback . the most disgusting role in the film is reserved for " gazillionaire " computer geek alan cumming , he is the simpering coward , the most unmanly and therefore the most unseemly one in the film . it could have been built as the battle between the sleaze champ vs . the egomaniac . it's an undeveloped role , but caine is so good at getting credibility for his character , someone who pretends to have nothing to gain from the murder , who could therefore be honest about what happened , but is , of course , somehow involved in the cover-up . there are several other sleazes around , who have various things to add to the story , such as more gratuitous violence and a seamy look at their lives . since carter fails to heed such warnings , these two will clash in seattle . anyway , no minor b-thriller should be without such a car chase . the only positive spin i could put on this morose work , is to say that it could have been a lot worse , stallone could have talked in a loud voice . this is just another in a long list of films since the 1980s to try and resurrect sylvester stallone's " comeback . " this picture won't do . it lacks whatever suspense , character development , and ability to involve the viewer , that is needed . it only features the ego of stallone plodding his way in a shallow story . if you want to see " get carter , " rent the 1971 video . it's a nasty story , but it holds together in purpose and credibility , catching hold of the downtrodden newcastle atmosphere in a subtle way , something this film was never able to realize for seattle . 
this parody of other gangster films suffers from a bad case of mindless imitation and hapless comedy that might be funny to someone in japan , but does not have a universal appeal . it is a parody of how the yakuza is portrayed in kitano films . it also pays homage to many other gangster films from around the world , including france's " diva . " it tries to take dramatic situations that occurred in those films and apply them out of context here , by poking fun at the hit man's mystique . sawaki when asked about his work , just feels his job is dull . noguchi asks him , " does your heart ever thump with excitement like it did when you were a kid ? " the fun in the film is mainly for film buffs , who will spot a wide variety of gangster films being used as a source for the levity here . the film's conclusion is a mixture of madcap comedy and an attempt to give meaning to all the lives of the dreamers who befriended sawaki . humor is subjective , you can't convince anyone that something was funny when they aren't laughing . i didn't laugh at what i was seeing , though i found the film to be stylish , shot in an outpouring of mellow brown and blue-gray shades . 
a sitcom type of nonsensical comedy , one that has abolutely no bite . everyone in it is a cartoonish character , with the satire nonexistent and the comedy coming in a forced and heavy-handed manner derived from its physical comedy . it is such a forgettable film , that i forgot it 3/4 of the way through . if there is anything amusing about this film , which is doubtful , it comes at awkward moments for the two convicts , who are trapped into being perceived as homosexuals . their romance seemed artificial , sort of like filler stuff for the fluff story . not to be undone by harry , wayne has an equally unconvincing romance with miss shaefer . and to make things fit the formula pattern of this very soft satire , chappy and harry start dating . this romance was just as unconvincing as the others . the convicts are caught in awkward tender moments , which is where the comic effort is always going . if this were on tv , where it belongs as a sitcom , there would be canned laughter during the mock romantic scenes . this bank robbery is the final clumsy attempt to draw laughs out of its unconvincing story , but this robbery scene was too witless to watch without cringing . the film lacked the art of making these situations funny . . . it didn't know how to draw satire out of situations that were set to be mocked . the actors were pleasant . . . but they just weren't too funny or believable . 
the same old romantic comedy formula story that has become a hollywood trademark is revived here , only this time its formula involves 'beverly hills conveniently meeting notting hill . ' give me a break , who in their right mind is seriously asking that question . the answer lies in the shekels found in the box office over the years , as this trite story line , the romance between opposites and the cute obstacles layed before them , seems to draw its fateful audience ever since hollywood was a hill that filmmakers put up a lettered sign on . what the film is 'banking' on , is the star personalities will continue to do their trick and milk their charms for mucho profit . roberts will fill the screen with her innocent and bountiful smile and grant will exploit that hangdog stereotype look he has cornered the market on , of one who is naturally shy but is persistent . they ape playing themselves as parodies , though who knows what they are really like , which is irrelevant , anyway . what is added to this often tried and tested screen formula , is pg-13 safe humor and a mild story where love blossoms in the way hollywood wills it to . think of any cary grant screwball comedy vehicle and you will know that this plot has been perfected in a much better way in other films . unfortunateley this film is not on the same level of cary's films . screenwriter richard curtis' dull workmanlike script seems to have the knack in getting to hugh grant's screen presence , the one that brings the paying audience in , as he previously did for him in " four weddings and a funeral , " but can't go further than that . roger michell's direction is predictable and lackluster , and the film itself is simply old stuff served again , dried out except for those who still find these superficial stars charming enough to think that this plot is viable again . there is no accounting for taste and who has taste , and no one's taste is better than your own , so if you like the stars then you will probably like the film no matter what . when superstar anna comes into humble william's bookstore and gets a book on turkey , you can guess the direction the rest of the film will travel to . there are no surprises here , unless you consider her soul kiss of william as she hurriedly leaves to be a surprise . they pop up all through the story to give the film its kooky british flavor and homey feeling . reality is blended so finely into the story that it never gets in the way of the fantasy romantic comedy happenings . it does what hollywood always does , give hope to those in the audience that fantasies can come true . you can bet your fairy tale book collection , that after hugh grant will go through all the obligatory obstacle courses required in the formula story , he will prevail and get julia roberts . the comedy unfolds as we watch how gracious the self-absorbed roberts is to the plebians , even confessing to them about her perpetual diet and that she's a bad actress making $15 million a picture , and we also see how nice and whacky the ordinary brits are , fawning over the american screenstar . since julia is not a blushing innocent in this film , she takes on the role of the one calling the shots , the film will go through all the formula tested tribulations in their relationship , with her looking less attractive to me than looking like she's a hardened woman with an empty soul . the only one in the film that had any fun in him that was sometimes funny , was grant's slob welsh flatmate , spike ( rhys ) , who spreads his goofiness around like it was manna from heaven , until even his dressed-down comic efforts feel forced . but , without his presence , even if his role was also a stereotype one , this asinine film would have been even more unbearable than it was . " notting hill " takes you to a low point on the movie making hill , where you can step on horseshit and curse out loud or pretend that it is not horseshit or be a man about it and say you fell into it , just like the filmmaker expected you to , and honestly say you like horseshit and don't care what anyone else thinks . this is the kind of film hollywood makes best . . . it's so easy to make and the romance is so painless . give me a bloody break . . . ! 
a rather mild comedy/mystery , filmed in b&w , featuring the bumbling comic antics of jack lemon and the ravishing beauty of kim novak . under richard quine's laborious direction , the film plods along until it perks up for its surprising ending , which is a takeoff on those slapstick silent comedies . the film failed to catch my interest even though the actors seemed to be giving an all out effort to make this turkey have legs . the main problem lies in the ridiculous script . his part was so wooden , you could have thrown it into the fireplace for kindling wood . the hilarious moments come , as lemon bumbles around while courting the mysterious kim . its offbeat comedy just didn't resonate with me . i found the production too dry and hardly on par with those buster keaton vehicles it tried to emulate and the mystery story was too lame-brain an effort to cause any fuss over . this one's watchable only for those fans of kim or lemon . i do not count myself as being one of those fans . 
the film was shot on the rugged , isolated terrain of the isle of man , which added to the film's bleakness . this drawn-out tragic love story manages to get at the characters it highlights , though what it uncovers is more obvious than startling or insightful . it was a thoroughly uncomfortable but poignant scene , shot in mostly brown and yellow coloring . he is without regard for culture or books . the script provides no plausible explanation for all the confusion going on in her head . it seemed to be a no-brainer which one to choose . it was obvious from the get-go that harry wasn't for her , therefore the film lacked tension in her choice of who to be with . this film reminded me of a thomas hardy type of novel that was written by someone who didn't have the writer's obvious talents and has come up with a story that mostly captures the stark atmosphere of the rural community but does not put a proper perspective on the psychology of the characters . 
this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard . but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly . this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice . jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson . the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian . if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch " mad dog morgan " ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner . 
the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were . on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . the film ends on a whimper . . . with this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work . it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . 
a terribly unreal end of the world film , even though it is laced in the everyday world of a family drama . it's a thriller stressing supernatural shocks and fuzzy apocalypse dramatizations , that has the cast trying hard to be convincing about all the hokum presented of bloody rivers in nicaragua , dead fish in haiti as the sea boils , of birds falling from the sky , the earth shaking , ice in the israeli desert in the same place as sodom , and hailstones on fairfax ave . if i said hard to believe , i really mean this film was so ludicrous , that it was impossible to believe . the film was so dreadfully out of touch with its own story , that it kept piling on different situations which only made its far-out story even more implausible . lack of clarity became the only clear thing about the film . the film lacked a decent script , meaningful acting , and credible direction . it is a silly film -- but not one that was funny in a campy way . the film's moral message that the world can be saved with hope , seemed like mush . 
a poorly made thriller , reeking from conventionality and lacking real suspense . it is played as a revenge film about a framed housewife who aims to get even with her slimy husband , but on the way to the film's payoff , the action is dull and unconvincing . all the characters are emotionally uninvolving . the script was lifeless and everything about the story seemed contrived , not to mention that there were huge holes in the plot . she looked so dolled up and refreshed , that it was hard to believe she was not at a country club , and those jailbird ladies getting her hip to doing underhanded things , like running traces on missing people , weren't just the sweetest dolls in the world . i felt as if i was watching a movie done by the numbers , as it plodded through every scene as if the film was being made for a film school class , while the film seemed alive only in its moments of action . the film makes a big deal about this in its plot , but when it comes time to have the payoff go that way , it chicken outs to convention and ends its story in the usual way tv crime stories end . in conventional films like this one , someone who rails against the common man's lack of art knowledge , deserves to be cast as the villain . the story made little sense , but if you are looking for some bright spot in the film , try the quaint new orleans cemetery as a pivotal background setting that helped magnify the suspense of the story . that location scene is all i enjoyed about this rather trivial and commercially made suspense film . no viewer should mistake it for a hitchcock and have to receive a scolding for that mistake by some film critic snob . 
the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects . that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them . this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet . it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future . the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement , and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents , who do not trust each other . the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics , as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity . delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin , monty python fans , and those who liked terry gilliam's brazil , a film similar in spirit . 
it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life . these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves . so ho's need pimps . '' the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , " but no further clarity is attempted . the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . 
this is a poorly directed and scripted derivative casino heist movie , shamelessly stealing jokes , plot situations and shootout scenarios from many other such films , including " ocean's 11 , " " honeymoon in vegas , " " the limey , " and " reindeer games . " all the main characters are unappealing , even the young boy can't get over as someone appealing . but the most disheartening thing about this irrelevant flick , was its unethical conclusion and its totally amoral characterization of the film's stars . there is not one person worth too much in this motley crew of lowlifes . the only lame joke that made me laugh , was when one gang member asked , what's the advantage of dating a homeless woman ? the answer is , you can drop her off anywhere . this film is so ridiculous , that as one of the cynical fbi men wisecracks , after learning about murphy's rap sheet , " you can't make stuff like this up . " unfortunately the screenwriters lichtenstein and recco did , which makes for a particularly distasteful film . the only thing the film has going for it , is that the situation and the characters are so ludicrous and full of elvis twitches , that there is certain kind of enjoyment to be found in a film as bad as this one is -- that might be taken by some as a guilty pleasure . 
the gimmicky premise grabs your attention , but the film fails to maintain its suspense as the story line becomes increasingly more absurd . why the nondescript , everyman character played by depp , would believe that walken wouldn't kill his daughter anyway , even if he did kill the governor , is just one of the major flaws in this ridiculous premise . if you buy into the story line , then you should find the film suspenseful in the hitchcock style . if you don't , the only consolation is that the acting was good . as far as i'm concerned , it was a preposterous premise and even if believed , the plan was far too risky and complicated for those involved , and there is no way the high insiders in the governor's camp wouldn't have come up with another plan to use , like the usual one of a professional assassin with a high-powered rifle . the only surprise the film could have for me , is if both depp's daughter and the governor were killed . this unnotable suspense yarn , brings little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which was more silly than tense . director john badham ( " saturday night fever''/ " stakeout'' ) tells the story effectively in real time , which makes it a watchable though forgettable film . 
steal this movie ! it meant well , showing the charismatic abby in the best possible light as the '60s prankster symbol of anarchistic , ecstatic , anti-establishment revolution , but this clich ? biopic failed to be emotionally involving , it had no craziness to it . . . and . . . its false sense of piety to its subject ruined the whole point of the film . i read hoffman's steal this book ! the film , adapted from two books -- abbie and anita hoffman's " to america with love : letters from the underground " and marty jezer's " abbie hoffman : american rebel , " was two goody-goody in its approach to capture either the mood of the changing times or the manic-depressive mood swings of the unabashed publicity hound , who thought of himself as a hippie organizer . admittedly , making a film about the '60s ( in this film abbie's starry-eyed days were between 1967-70 ) is not easy to do because of the problem of making a satire about what was a satire to begin with , but this film was so poorly scripted , directed and acted , that it is worst than most films about that era . d'onofrio who is a big man does not physically resemble the much smaller hoffman and his odd boston accent sounded artificial . he does bring an energy to the role , but it seems misplaced as he seems to have made the one thing abbie had going for him , a real sense for comedy and wit , seem nonexistent , as the script is so self-serving to him and his lawyer , that it made the whole project stink . the only thing d'onofrio does well , is try and steal this movie for himself . all the other roles were flatly played and had no impact on the film . 
this film , a roger corman exploitation b-film , is a relic of the 1960s and its only value might be in helping sociologists discover what went wrong with that era's visions of universal love . it's a good trip as opposed to a bad trip movie , scripted by none other than jack nicholson . it sugar coats the acid experience and promotes it as if it was a commercial for a product seen on tv . the film itself was a trip in visual clich ? s . it was also comical without trying to be , as i lost count of how many significant groovies , man , and wows were said . the result is a film that looks and feels stilted and untrue . it should be an embarrassment for those who participated in it , because of its fake sixties hipsterisms . well , there you are , that's the film's plot and its resolution . bruce dern acts as a guru for fonda's initiation into lsd , telling him " i'm gonna be here , man , trust me . " soon fonda is saying things like everything is alive , i feel energized -- i'm into some beautiful stuff . none of his acid experiences seemed to be anything but trivial and hedonistic ones ; the scene in the laundrymat was the only one that made me laugh . this aip cheapie looked cheap , as even the garish visuals -- which should have been super , were flat and mind-bending in the wrong way . there was nothing on this trip worth seeing . it offers a false sense of nostalgia for those who were into acid , and for others , they should get a good laugh at the expense of someone else's unintentionally bad film . 
this is also shown to be the prevailing opinion of every other coal miner in town--that it's something only for the lassies to do . this was the most energetic scene in the film and the only one that kept me fully awake , as the kid convinced me he could dance with pep . 
it's an old-fashioned type of film , that has the main characters talking in phony polish accents and throwing out schmaltzy dialogue at will , as it suffers so much from being poorly scripted . there must have been a reason why neophyte director/writer theresa connelly made this film into a nostalgia story that wants to look like it was made in the 1950s , i just wish she included that reason as part of the storytelling and dropped all those clich ? s to explain every situation . in the realm of movies that try so hard to please its audience , this one almost begs for audience approval , but the only thing that should please the crowd is the sex appeal of the beautiful looking ensemble cast . i'm sure there could have been some comedy over this , but the film was so flat , it couldn't draw out the comedy or any worthwhile observation about this zany situation . it didn't work for me , i got no warm and fuzzy feeling for this working-class family . it was a film of many vignettes , all coming together with the themes of family values , sex , and religion , but none of the themes is brought to any fruition where it could register with any credibility . 
a film that could have been an interesting study about a cold-blooded hit man , but instead ends up without much to say that isn't banal . what it best offers is a colorful but artificial touristy look at spain and belgium . the remainder of the supporting cast has little to do . the script by s . lee pogostin is a weak one , as is his original screenplay , as is his flat way of directing . the film belabors its point about how violence is killing the world and preaches to a snoozing audience how love can soften even the coldest of individuals . he wears dark sunglasses and has a cane , which would indicate blindness , but his part is so underwritten , that he's not explained at all , he's just around to be part of the scenery . sterling says : " murder is like going through a tunnel , once you go through it you have gone past it . " this should have been a noir film , one with a different cast , script , director , and cinematographer . just about everything about this film is wrong . 
this is a ridiculous film . if you think about it , it just doesn't make sense . it's a tale about wishy-washy " humanitarianism . " that is something i just find hard to believe always happens ( opinions often change , but people ( principles ) do not ) . it's a manipulative film and if you go with the flow of the story and accept the logic presented , then everything is manufactured to make you eschew reason and be persuaded by your blind emotional responses . this is a middle-brow art film and even though it pretends to offer more , it doesn't . it should only serve those who go to films to be entertained in the way a vacuous hollywood film does , where the viewer is expected not to care how ridiculous the story is . what this film is best at doing , is having its star actors look good and have a cinematographer , like eduardo sarra ( leconte himself did a lot of the filming ) , make a static film look stimulating by beautifully photographing it . these are diversionary tactics that can easily lull one into just going into a slumber and accepting this contrived film at face value without giving it a further thought . patrice leconte ( " ridicule " ) latest film " the widow of st . pierre " is particularly annoying because it is so smug . it is a film that stacks the deck in the murderer's favor and could care less about the murder victim . if the film's aim is to make a case against capital punishment , it succeeds only in making a case for phony compassion . i'm afraid the filmmaker's aims are just to make a movie pushing its star cast into appealing fantasy roles and sucking the viewer into believing the film is serious in tackling tough issues because the stars are taking their roles in a serious manner . its moral high ground against capital punishment was not only unconvincing , but it leaves a bitter feeling in the air . do-gooders generally manage to do more harm than good , and that will prove itself in this film as well . the widow of saint-pierre is juliette binoche ( in my book , she's the julia roberts of french movies , matching the american in superficial acting techniques ) . it might be of interest to note , that guillotine is a slang word for " widow " in french . basically , this is a bourgeois story about the self-righteous couple wallowing in their comfort and materialism and self-aggrandizing powers . his blank look at his situation is probably what the director expects from his ideal movie viewer . this is a visually pleasing film ; it has nothing more to offer than a make believe tale about real issues and concerns that the film can't get to because of its own arrogance in filmmaking . 
a good spoof on the church , but it is ruined by its vulgarity , excesses and absurdity . the ensemble cast is made up of many stars in cameo roles , but that does not guarantee that the acting is good . even if there was no controversy , this film is too weird and too poorly put together to deserve a theater release . the film is a series of sight gags , nasty one-liners , pronouncements against the church , and awkward comic scenes . most of it is inane , but one of its good moments is when it is said : a good reason for keeping the hand as a miracle , is that it gives people a religious belief in the hereafter and because of that they would be nicer to each other . it is directed with reckless abandon by alfonso arau ( like water for chocolate/a walk in the clouds ) , with a disarming heavy-handedness and lack of subtlety ( it ends by this in-your-face statement : god is sending a message , if you can't take a joke , go f * ck yourself ) . it's a strictly for the pits film , but it did get in a few good body punches on the church . the one i liked best is : if jesus wasn't killed , you wouldn't have a religion . 
a mindless film noir set in arizona . the film it resembles most is " bad lieutenant " ( 1992 ) . in imitation of pulp fiction , there's lots of frivolous talk . it's a film liotta saw a 100 times . harry is a good guy with an honorable code of ethics and would be fine , if his gambling habit didn't make him so twisted . the film has nothing to say that makes sense , the acting was forgettable , the dialogue was trite , and all the characters seemed to be out to lunch . it's a film that will not rise from it's ashes . 
open secret is a quality story , but is a cheaply produced b-film with similar themes about anti-semitism as " crossfire " and " gentleman's agreement . " this is one of the rare occasions that leonard played a cop instead of a gangster . the story should hold your interest . 
a dull and oppressingly long three-hour ode to the glory of war and killing . this strictly commercial film's budget was for $135 million and uses as its model for financial success " titanic " and its anti-historical way of telling its historical story . it's a film made for the huge crowds it hopes to pull in , by giving them all the goo they could possibly ingest in one sitting . it ran a clich ? romance story for two hours worth of the film and after 80 minutes of this corny love story , the japanese at last attack pearl harbor and the film to its credit accurately gets the chaos of the events right ( the only thing it got right in the film ) . this invasion was the heart of the film and lasted for about 40 minutes ; it got its money's worth in good airplane battle footage from the computer-generated imagery ( though the scene itself had a flatness that made it appear uninvolving but competenly done ; there was no emotional resonance to any of the action ; it was respected for its technical achievement rather than for being artistic ) . for the last third of the film you could have skipped out and missed nothing , because it went back to that annoying love story it was hammering out . every thing about this film was second rate ; especially , when compared to modern war films such as " saving private ryan . " the trite dialogue , inept script , misuse of history , irritating character portrayals , the soapy background music , and the clanky acting by everyone concerned , made this overlong work into a critical bomb . every character was a stock character seen in many other hollywood films . i couldn't help myself from laughing , it was such a silly attempt at patriotism . that's about as deep as we get into their characters . kate has fine features and virtuous good looks , and an empty expression that is the same both for love of rafe and of country . the film plays it safe and lays no blame on why pearl harbor was so unprotected . no character in the film had any shading or depth , everyone was a forgettable personality . the one-dimensional characters just say their lines and the film keeps moving along . though this film failed in every which way to provide a history lesson , or an engaging story , or be an entertaining film ; still i'm afraid it will have box-office success . it reduced everything to the lowest commom denominator by the crass bruckheimer rules for commercial success ( keep the dialogue banal and down to the film's theme , and keep everything in motion so no ideas could get in the way of the mindless violence on the screen ; this way it remains on a fourth grade level and can be easily understood by the masses ) . it would be difficult to make a film more shallow than this one ; but , i'm cynically looking forward to bay and bruckheimer teaming up again , i think they have the potential to stoop lower than they have so far ( because as bad as this film was , it could have been worst ) . 
i'm not an admirer of philip kaufman's ( the unbearable lightness of being ) previous films . in quills he has adapted doug wright's play to create a drab period piece of the marquis de sade story . it lacks an edginess , as the shocks against civilization's sensibility are not geared to move the intellect . its theme embellished the belief that freedom is in writing without censorship . the film's rallying cry could be , 'bring me a quill ! ' it was a time of mixed messages in the areas of social reform and repression . kaufman shot this dreary tale at pinewood studios and used mostly an english cast , though some cast members were australian and american . in this version , the marquis de sade is made out to be more of a misguided writer and a witty aristocrat than truly a murderous villain . there are many quotes from his writings , but not those that show him in his more beastly nature . royer-collard is reduced to be more the villain than the marquis is . he has the most solid role in the film and makes the best of it . kate winslet didn't convince me she was a peasant laundress , but she still came off with a feisty although a forgettable performance . the film failed because it was too dull to be entertaining and it didn't have anything startling to say about a startling subject to be intellectual . its shrill moments outweighed its moments of irony , when it was able to show how insane the men of reason were in their treatment of the mentally ill . this was a middlebrow work , that made light of the innovative marquis as a man who was merely politically incorrect rather than completely debased . aiming at those targets is like shooting at ducks in a pond . 
you'll need some kind of a pill to sit through this soap opera piece of dreck . become recognized as the ultimate in trash pics . it's a film mired in banality and in a risible dialogue . but broadway doesn't go for booze and dope - now get out of my way , i've got a man waiting for me . " another sample of the film's trite dialogue goes like this : agent : it's a rotten business . neely : " but i love it . " this clich ? -ridden film is as bad as these types of films ever get . but some have embraced it for its campiness . suit yourself ! i can't see a fan of hollywood films ignoring an infamous classic pic like this one forever . it is interesting to note , that all the men the girls become associated with are either : gay , sick , cheats , mean to them , or just plain wimps . that's showbiz i guess , according to the valley of the dolls . you should love the pic's bad acting by everyone except hayward . 
this is a tense hostage-gangster film set in the 1940s , so the hoods wear fedoras and business suits . it seems more like a play than a film , and that is not surprising since it was originally a play . his bleeding-heart liberal attitude is not thought of much at present but in this film it seems to be the voice of reason , as if criminal behavior can be explained away by a bad environment and by getting counseling when in trouble . it's all pop psychology , but the actors are so serious about it that it's amusing to hear them say their lines with a straight face . so i guess the shrink knew what he was doing ! this is pure hollywood hokum . though , it is well-acted and is watchable . 
former hal hartley actress adrienne shelly directs her second feature , a low budget indie about a blind date gone bad . it's a romantic comedy which manages to show a lot of grief over the loss of a loved one . there's no bill pullman in this film so pullman clone , reg rogers , plays the main role of the dumped husband . this will turn out to be a shrill role for sheedy , who never seems like a real person . bernice talks a mile a minute and the disinterested sad sack bill finally gets a word in and nastily tells her " you're ordinary and pathetic . " i found this scene to be particularly dull and wondered why it was so scripted that bernice had to be told her granny had a lover by max and wouldn't have already have known about it , that is if she was such a caring grandchild as the film wanted her to be portrayed as . the film's quirky resolution comes at the point of a gun or two . it makes some point about getting to know the one you fall in love with . since i didn't find much comedy here ( only a lot of silliness ) and wasn't taken in with the characters or their troubles , i merely went along for the bumpy ride and tried not to wince too much at the forced comedy situations . this film could have used hartley's magical cinematic touch big time and a tighter script if it was going to take me somewhere i hadn't been before . 
a bleak indie film about a stolen identity . there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean . the film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground . it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging . 
the film is filled with violence , vulgar dialogue , and seems devoid of real feelings . it relies on twists in the plot to keep you tuned into the investigation and shocking scenes to keep you aghast at the horrors of being in vietnam . the acting was flat , the story was trite , and the suspense was marginal . 
an old-fashioned " jock " flick , notwithstanding that all the basketball players are white and the game seemed played in slo-mo . this one plays as a moralistic tale about the temptations placed before young athletes , and how the hook goes into them making them succumb to fix games . everything about the story is obvious , and it ends as predictably as it begins . it plays like an old newsreel piece ; a study of a different era that has little relevancy for today . it was second-rate as far as acting and the story line had the stench of a locker room smell all over its reels . 
this is not one of the filmmaker's better comedies , it seems too preachy in trying to convince us of how sex and love go together like politics and politicians . it was all ho-hum . . . who cares , as the characters could never be seen as real people and the action was dull and ridiculous . at one point in the film , a character is offered the choice of hearing barry white or vivaldi -- and -- without a hesitation chooses white . i would have chosen vivaldi , but barry white songs are played throughout , thereafter , and in my opinion were the most lively thing about this film . the film is set in lyon , where we are told there is a large unemployment problem and because of that men seek pleasure from prostitutes more than they do in good times . the belabored point made is , what a joy sex is . blier just didn't take this story anywhere , even the elegant charms of the very ladylike whore , grinberg , soon loses its appeal . i grew weary trying to follow blier's logic , and what he had to say didn't seem to add up ; i wasn't laughing at any of his satires . it turned into sentimental tv sitcom stuff instead of following through on the theme of all the sexual alienation there is in society , a theme it quickly jettisoned for no discernible reason by following the pimp around instead of the whore ; especially , since it had nothing else to say that mattered . 
it is a pretentious arty film set in 1929 , which failed to be credible or involving . the story was emotionally flat and the contrived ending was ludicrous ( this was not the same ending in the novel ) . dalloway ) tried to say in this merchant-ivory styled literary film . it was a drawn out glossy affair stuffed with empty gestures to the arts , and i could never figure out what john turturro was trying to do with his role as the chess genius , who is both a social misfit and someone who is mentally unstable , except to ham it up by acting over-the-edge . there just never seemed to be any point or excitement to this film , as adapted by screenwriter peter berry from vladimir nabokov's ironic novel . this film is devoid of nabkov's wit and irony , it reminded me only of a film that was concerned with showing a pretty face , some pretty scenery to look at , and eschewing any controversy . the film was devoid of any fascist's presence , even though mussolini had come to power in the early part of the 1920s , so even the period film's background history is distorted . these flashbacks were an attempt at making crass amateur psychological explanations for luzhin's emotional unstability due to his wretched upbringing . these scenes are conventional and added little meaning to luzhin's personal dilemma . everything about luzhin seems heavy-handed and done only for effect and not to develop his character . whatever happens to him seemed overwrought and artificial . his over-acting and the way the film tried to make this unfeeling love affair into a real one , had a disingenous feel to it . this film felt heavy at all times , like it was load of manure being dumped on a story that deserved a better fate than this film was able to give it . 
these aliens avoid the light and strike when it's dark . this sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography , as it was filmed in the australian outback , and for its innovative editing cuts . the story line left me gasping for more light and the acting left me in the dark searching for one line of dialogue that wasn't shrill or trite . no actor was provided with a challenging part , but diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate this action story . he comes to say one-liners such as this : " they did not know who they were f * cking with ! " he says this to the dead aliens after he puts them out of their misery , but he might as well have spoken it to a dead audience . the writer/director david twohy ( the arrival ) tries to bring some intelligence to the story , but the script is too predictable to keep one interested in it . the characters ranged from a shrill radha to a cartoonlike diesel , making it easy to root for the aliens to possibly , against all formula film odds , pick off all the survivors of the spacecraft . but three do survive and , in my opinion , that's three too many ! this film didn't have a clue about what point it wanted to make . it was particularly unclear how good or bad they wanted to portray diesel's character , as he kept changing from bad to good guy at every alien sighting . by the film's end i had an empty feeling , knowing i saw another special effect sci-fi film that couldn't bring on a story . 
a far-fetched thriller that bogs done in an incredible situation by the film's last 20 minutes . there's something dry about her performance . there's also the lack of chemistry in the relationship she has with the spader character . this was not a very satisfying thriller : it lacked conviction , memorable performances , and intelligent dialogue . an example of the film's inane dialogue can best be heard in a typical conversation between the two protagonists . spader : you're a psychopath . amick : even psychopaths can still love somebody . this kind of talk might be especially appealing to the psychopaths in the audience . there weren't many layers to peel away from this story before discovering how manipulative it was , how it was without a strong actor's presence , and how it failed to make a strong psychological imprint ; the characters were made into objects of a contrived tale causing the film to lag . 
leatrice is also responsible for popularizing the bobbed hair look , which was the style of her hair for this film . this is fluff romantic/comedy that has many holes in the story ; this makes the film lacking in certain basic standards of filmmaking . it's also reflective of the 1920s male chauvinistic attitude toward women , where it can be said with a straight face by one of the main lady characters : " that a man wants beauty not brains in a woman . " and aren't you wonderful ! when he demonstrates the machine , doolittle sneakily fixes it so it splatters over all those watching the demo . it's also beyond me how the family could invite someone as devious as that into their home . but , in any case , the brainy a . b . that seems to be the way a 'feel good' movie went in those days , as it leaves the audience with a happy feeling . this same formula is still used by the hollywood film , but the film's are much more polished today . the clinging vine is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination , but it does present an historical perspective of those silent era times . 
a ponderous melodrama that even becomes more awkward by the film's end . the doctor prescribes for her a powerful pain-killing pill that is fatal if more than one is taken within an hour . 
a fluff sitcom , romantic comedy , that is so charming that it eventually suffocates on all the charm it gives off . it is cleverly written and directed by irish playwright gerard sternbridge , who can't stop showing off how clever he is able to make his main character . the film was shot almost a year before " almost famous " made kate hudson into a celebrity , and a golden globe winner and oscar nominee for best supporting actress . in any case , kate does a flawless irish accent . he's a bullshit artist extraordinaire , with an easy manner about him , who cunningly knows how to reach out to women , which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but after that became annoying . his gracious smile soon looked too smug and unbecoming , as the story had no particular meaning to it and i have seen too many recent films with studs in it to care how this silly story resolved itself . this film resolved itself in the cute way the story was heading , a 'feel good' film for those with an amoral bent and a belief that having sex with as many women as possible is the best thing one can do to improve relationships . for all the main characters there's a voice-over used to spell out their thoughts and also captions of their thoughts are at times flashed onscreen . scenes are also repeated so we get reactions from different individuals . the film's main purpose seems to be in showing what a likable rake adam is -- that he is willing to meet the needs of whomever he's with . he proves that having secrets in a relationship can add spice to it and make it an even more serene and lasting one . this is contrasted with adam being shown by the film's end as a pathological liar and an uncaring sexist . the film's image of him left me confused about what i was supposed to think of him . but my gut reaction is , i had a belly full of this guy long before the film ended and therefore found this vacuous story unsatisfying . it was like i was being asked to overlook adam's failings and be won over by his obviously trite charms . i wasn't and therefore didn't care for adam , or the film , or did i particularly care for any of the sisters . the only thing i liked in the film was the jaguar , and i didn't care how adam got it or what story he told about how he got it . that was supposed to be funny and show that he might have some problems with telling the truth . 
a poorly crafted revenge action film , that seems to be satisfied with itself for being so muddled and image conscious . gonin is a slickly done visual treat in bizarre behavior and violence , with homoerotic overtones . this is a nonstop action flick styled after those recent hong kong action films of john woo , ringo lam , and tsui hark . since i'm not a fan of the originators of this genre , i'm especially not partial to their imitators . " gonin , " which means 'the five , ' is devoid of character development and a coherent story , or anything but mindless blood-and-gore and an outpouring of jump-cuts and fast editing . but even with all those filmmaking tricks of the trade , the action scenes seem like they're in slo-mo when compared to the hong kong ones . the hitmen quickly locate all of them since the gang fails to cover-up their identities properly , and the film becomes a vehicle for showy performances . the only memories from this film are of the gruesome kind , as killing is the thing here and director ishii--who used to illustrate manga--hyperrealistic , action-packed japanese comics--goes all the way with this theme by making it into a cartoonlike story . there's definetly an audience for this type of cultish film , except don't count me as one of those happy viewers . i prefer my violent flicks to make a little more sense and have at least some character development . tarantino's reservoir dogs looks like a shakespearian classic compared to this b-film , one that hopes to get by with its all-star cast and the menacing performance by the indomitable takeshi " beat " kitano . 
it's a love it or hate it film . i simply hated it . on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner . it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed . a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films . it's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other . these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that's possible . it's not explained how he happens to be chinese . the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film's title . here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout . this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings . i'll take a pass on this one , it's just not my style of a film . the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget . 
a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book " the shovel and the loom , " goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha . 
the film is a muddled effort to make them into hero and heroine , and the effort to do that seemed to misfire somewhere in the long sea journey home for wayne . why this is so , sure beats me . napier fires on the freighter and destroys it . the film ends in mystery , as it is not certain if ehrlich and elsa escaped or were killed . as for me , i could care less--this was one of the duke's poorer films . it was a tedious chase and an irrelevant story , and the dialogue was just atrocious . this letterboxed version was watchable only to see how lana acts while wearing furs , evening dresses , and tight sweaters aboard the freighter . 
one of chabrol's weaker films . there wasn't much magic in the magic show he put on . the video version i saw was badly dubbed in english and showed tunisian subtitles . it's a b-mystery story that engages the occult for its plot , as it asks you to believe that there are clairvoyants who could see what is pre-destined . the magician is certain that sylvia is doomed . chabrol is having some fun spoofing the conventions of magic and the rationality of science , and how the idle rich have nothing to do in this world but make trouble . the story was slight , the suspense was not earth shattering , and it resulted in film that hardly mattered . 
a sophomoric action comedy with a distinctive australian flavor , relying on screw ups to provide the comic situations . should appeal to teenagers and to those who think like them , and for those who just like a madcap film and don't concern themselves with plot and character development . i'll give the film credit for having a lot of pep and for being quirky . it's much like ritchie's " lock , stock and two smoking barrels , " as its humor is of the physical kind equally mixing a crime caper story with dumb or , if you prefer , black comedy . the film doesn't know how to gracefully end , but it does end on an a too cutely done amoral note . this comes after a few more plot twists . it was shown at the sundance film festival of 1999 . it was a harmless entertainment venture , of limited value . it's one of many recent world-wide films about combining comedy in a urban crime pic , though a new type of pic for the aussies . this one is forgettable , but somewhat likable because of the lead characters . 
ladd speaks in a laconic monotone voice , while jones is shrill and unappealing . besides the dullness of the story , it seemed far-fetched . it seemed as if the film ran out of oxygen and just wanted to end . vickey is warm to him , but the others treat him with disrespect . the drama never had much of an impact , and the story seemed silly and misplaced . it over sentimentalized the children and made the adults into wooden caricatures of evil . ladd seemed miscast , while jones failed to be convincing in her role . 
this was one of the poorer charlie chan episodes . also , the story was much too confusing , with too many characters appearing in uninteresting or unexplainable roles . there was hardly any mystery to this tale , as it barely met the minimum formula requirements for a chan episode . the film is set in paris in 1938 , just at the possible outbreak of ww11 . this mystery doesn't have much of a mystery to it , as there is nothing to guess--the 'bad guys' are plainly evident . firstly , it's unbelievable how such a moron could be given that assignment , as there seemed to be no second-in-command . marcel is plain annoying , he's not funny , and he overacts nonstop . 
this b-film , directed by samuel fuller , is one that failed to work . the setup seemed so wooden , while the bourgeois villains seemed more like cartoon figures than real people . even the hero and the heroine failed to be convincing and looked more like imitations picked off the reels of other such b-films . they will rob the three counselors they despise -- mussolini , mr . desterne , and tartuffe -- and humiliate them in the same way they have been by them . this one should only be appreciated by sam fuller fans . 
a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . 
soul survivors , written and directed by steve carpenter , the writer of blue streak and the upcoming ocean's eleven remake , is a by-the-numbers horror movie whose only real scare comes from the sudden blast of a starter's pistol at a swim meet . even the ending explanation leaves plenty of plot holes to ponder . well , it would if the movie weren't so instantly forgettable . along the way people say trite little things to encourage the survivors . about the only reason to see soul survivors is if you are desperate for a guilty pleasure . carpenter tosses in a few erotic scenes , but ones that are in no danger of threatening his film's pg-13 rating . don't worry . they stay fully clothed at all times . this would be good advice for those who decide to see this movie . it is rated pg-13 for " terror/violence , sexuality and some substance abuse , " and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
there's not one character in this film that i felt anything for even though , i'm led to believe , i was supposed to . the film foolhardedly evokes dostoyevsky's " crime and punishment " as the inspiration behind this contemporary film about teen-age angst , yet leaves one with little to remind them of that except for the title . it's a story about outsiders who use violence to get what they want , as all the characters are severely dysfunctional and act goofy to make sure we know how screwed-up they are at all times . the question asked in all seriousness to sum up the film is too trivial to dignify with a serious response as it states even when a good person kills a bad person , it's still a tragedy . i don't see what's the big revelation about that , since i don't know of any sane person who doesn't realize that killing someone is a pretty serious thing . my other problem was i didn't know who was good , i just saw who was more vulnerable . i think it's rather pretentious and arbitrary to think this piece of pulp nonsense had caught the profound themes of the master russian writer . what it caught was a sleazy and exploitive look at a teen-age wasteland , and added nothing relevant to our understanding of such empty lives . that just has nothing to do with what dostoyevsky was getting at , it's just the typical trash seen in countless exploitive films . this unpleasant script by larry gross , seems to be vacuous and more annoying than anything intellectual it presents . it's a b-film that somehow thinks it could get over as an art film for the disenfranchised . when she said that , it came out of the blue and made absolutely no sense . i don't know what she found , but if she calls what she found love--then she lost me . this is one twisted pic . made all the worst because there's no fun in this nonsense uncovered . but the subject matter here is ripe for a steckler flick , as it's a shame the film wasted so much good photography techniques and good background music and some good acting improvisations on such an empty story . this film was released a year after the similar " american beauty , " even though it was made earlier . it therefore also suffers from being thought of as a copy of that film , even though it wasn't . 
the premise of this thriller might be good , but even a great director like fritz lang and a superb cast consisting of joan bennett and michael redgrave can't save this film from its sophomoric use of freud to give the film's conclusion a pat psychological response to a serious mental disorder presented . the psychology was never convincing , the only thing convincing about this silly film noir is the moody gothic atmosphere it captured . if lang was not the director , this film could have been a real stinker . but he evokes as much suspense as you can out of such nonsense , and the visual images by the great cinematographer stanley cortez are truly remarkable . the film is worth seeing only for those reasons . but even lang himself thought this was a poor film , and he'll get no argument from me on that score . 
it was shot semidocumentary style , with a sober voiceover telling of the growing juvenile delinquency problem in the film's beginning and ending on the note that it's up to the family , school , church groups . this rumble was the only thing that was remotely watchable in the film . it's amazing that a director like altman , who was to go on and have a great career in films , made such a feeble one here . the film might be of mild interest to those who desire to see how suburban white teens socialized , dated , had fights , and dealt with their parents back in the 1950s . . . . the film didn't even have good music to go with its teen story , and that includes julia lee singing her rendition of " dirty rock boogie . " 
another red scare propaganda film from the 1950s that is hideous . it's only saving grace is that it is well-crafted through the skills of director jacques tourneur . otherwise the film is largely a bore , saddled with endless speeches from the main characters and an outdated paranoic viewpoint . it also suffers from a ludicrous ending on the steps of the lincoln memorial , where the commie racketeers get their just desserts in a ridiculously contrived setting . the finale is not suspenseful , surprising , or even interesting . but it looks good in black and white photography , and all the actors are so earnest in their roles that it makes one pause before raining on their parade . it's too bad that such a horrible script fills the screen with a witch-hunt theme that gives off a false patriotism message . this film can make you see red ! 
this low-budget , inane , cheesy , message sci-fier was of such poor quality that it was laughable and entertaining in a way goofy films sometimes can be . the clunky message of the film ( the way the film presents it is clunky ) , is that all the world's nations should be working for peace and not getting into the nuclear arms race . but the invaders act to offer proof . delivering such a warning during a hockey game took my mind off the puck , but is that the proper world stage to deliver such a message ! this is a classic in bad sci-fi b-movies . highly recommended for those who understand that a film doesn't have to be good to be enjoyable . i liked it . . . mainly for its banal dialogue delivered in robotic tones ! 
a convoluted minor film noir story whose main distinction is that it is one of the few filmed in color from the 1950s . the story is slight , it's implausible , is melodramatic , and has action that is violent for violent's sake . it results in a film that distances itself from the audience , as there's not one character worth caring about . but she fails to tell jansen about this . but dorothy is as nutty as a fruit cake , so he sticks with june . the most interesting thing about this flick , was the cinematography of john alton . he managed to make the superscope color have noirish shadows even though it is filmed in a hideous shade of garish colors . otherwise , there's not much else memorable about this low-budget film , except for how ordinary and inane it is . 
the terror is more boring than it is scary . the film has a plot , but it is plodding and hardly seems up to being a b-movie of director roger corman's usual medium standards for such low-budget works . it's more interesting to know how the film was created in three days than to see the film . he also let a number of others direct various scenes that were not already written , which gives the film its muddled look . if that wasn't a silly enough premise and wasn't filled with so many holes in the story you could build a mountain on it , there's more hokum . there's not much to this film except for the moody scenes it sometimes creates and the gothic atmosphere conjured up ( a spooky castle with boris karloff sitting by a fireplace while attired in a regal bathrobe ) . that might be just enough to satisfy some hardcore corman and karloff fans . 
a mediocre thriller that seems to be made just for a video release and not for the theater . it's entertaining in a limited way , as it plays like a conventional crime tv series drama . but it infortunately gets bogged down with a clich ? d alcoholic and despondent detective as its star , a predictable and uninvolving formula serial killer story , and plot devices that are unbelievable . but what really brings this film down , is its ludicrous ending . it can best be viewed as a laffer , in a negative sense . this triggers in him the ability to experience psychic reactions , as he starts seeing things about the crime ; and , he also notices by touching an article of clothing , that's part of the crime , he could be stimulated to see even more . harvey tells him--i see things , too . it doesn't make sense at present , but by the time this predictable story winds down it becomes evident why he was given the case over more capable detectives . the middle part of the film takes its time developing as it shows many suspects as the possible serial killer , as the film wearily builds to the finale . the action shots are of kiefer seeing the brutal crimes being committed in his mind . it's all very forgettable stuff , as the actors are going through the motions of acting and this lame script fails to develop anything interesting to say about the psychic policeman . 
a lighthearted comedy farce built around a crime caper , but is mostly built around the star power of paul newman . the film misfires because of its weak script , lack of punch to its comedy , and the plot was too incredible to believe or become absorbed in . but if you're a fan of the 75-year-old sexy actor , paul newman , it must be good to see that he still looks good , can turn on the charm , and can still act with the best of them . the guards are not as alert then because there's no money collected , yet . the story itself is disappointing , but this is the kind of sexy and amoral role that fiorentino is very good at . it's somewhat pleasing and that could be enough to satisfy a certain type of audience . but if you really want my opinion , i wouldn't go two steps out of my way to see this one . 
joel schumacher's modestly budgeted , gritty looking war melodrama had nothing relevant to say , only saying things that have been said in countless other vietnam war films . the clich ? d hero and the formulaic story never caught my fancy , no matter how much the director tried to make things happen . it's in the style of the first half of full metal jacket , but without the same impact . it's the tale of a soldier who won't conform to the army and by the film's end proves he's not a bad guy and can also be an excellent soldier if he wants to . there were just no surprises forthcoming , as the film seemed to be marking time until it shows him as a leader and proves himself heroic . i think that schumacher thinks because he has no stars and shot this one in a grainy 16-millimeter with a jumpy hand-held camera and with mostly natural light in dogme style , that he caught something cinema v ? rit ? . what goes with schumacher wherever , is a lot of corn . this film is just as weak in storyline as was his big commercial flick batman . what this film has going for it , is some good shots of the swampland in fort polk , louisiana , and some good performances . the movie moves along as if it were on a forced march to hanoi . there's also some liberal claptrap thrown into the storyline , which is unconvincingly done about a racist sociopath . the film heads toward its less than 'big bang' finale in tigerland with the same forced messages about war that could not only chase sluts out of a hotel room but drive film critics to the theater's popcorn vender rather than sit through this torture in its entirety . the director must receive credit for at least getting together a good cast , though i would have loved to see this one with a ed wood jr . cast . 
they don't come gooier than this feel-good fluff piece without being too sugary for consumption . it's a romantic comedy that spins every formulaic device possible into overdrive to come up with its cutesy love story , missing only the presence of julia roberts and any sort of genuine passion . it plays as if it was an ad showing how the 'beautiful people' spend some quality time doing the nyc scene by taking in the waldorf astoria , bloomingdales , central park's wollman rink , and when looking up toward the skies they can even spot nyc's tallest skyscaper--the empire state building . it was all so superficial and predictable . the comedy was oooh so heavy-handed and the romance was unbearably contrived . to get in the mood for this goo , one has to find numerous coincidental situations believable even if they are not possible , which was asking too much from me . if you like a flick that's pretty to look at , has attractive leads , sells its love story like a $100 hooker sells herself at night in times square , is brainless and anti-septic , and requires no thought , then this film might be in your diet . after all she 'reasons , ' if that's a good word to use in this film review , they are both currently involved with someone else . house before a fireplace and a bunch of burning candles placed on stands at different heights in a setting that looks like it's an ad for furnishings placed in a bloomie's catalogue . can you guess if they will succeed ! the film gets comedy relief from the supporting cast . the one bit he does that saves this film for me , is write an hilarious obit for jon based on what the greeks might have said if they wrote obits for someone who died for love . he provides some laughs , except he hangs around too long in the story and begins to become tiresome . you can believe as this film does in " fate determining one's future , " but it does an awful job in proving its case . though , i've seen much worst romantic comedies . in this one , at least , the leads who didn't inspire me , didn't turn me completely off . which is the best i can say about this flick . 
it's a film that has the promise of being a horror story but that never quite comes together , as the film plays more like a schmaltzy nostalgia piece and bland character study about an all-american child of the 1950s , bobby garfield , who is in a bland coming-of-age film . there's not much of a story here that isn't a contrivance , or dripping with goo , or heading nowhere . and he doesn't appear to be a great seer , or someone who is very sensitive because he was hurt . as the friendship grows between the boy and the stranger , we are forced to hear such banal profundities from the pen of king uttered through the lips of hopkins as : " sometimes when you're young , you have moments of such happiness , you think you're living in someplace magical , like atlantis must have been . " everything about this film felt loaded down with good versus evil characters , with situations that seemed manufactured and did not have any flow to them . in fact you can guess how everything will turn out because there's no real story in this failed mystery story . the film's all about a contrived atmospheric mood it sets in mystery to lead you to believe something is going on , as it hopes your imagination will be better than the author's in finishing the story . in the end hopkins' portrayal is too creepy and ambivalent to draw any conclusion about what all his inward hurt means and why he seems so strange and saddened . we never see any of the lead characters develop or really get to know them , we are only led to what they might be or what they represent . everyone seemed like a cardboard character waiting for either the " low men " to emerge or for another trite golden nugget of wisdom to fall from the lips of hopkins . this film isn't even good enough to be considered a middle-brow art-house film , as it's a commercial film that tries to be a little off-kilter with little to offer in the way of suspense . 
it seems it was in his blood to be bad . i guess these character quirks are supposed to make him somewhat appealing , or show that he has some kind of psychological failings . the film , to its credit , did not make him out to be a good guy . i think if you look objectively at this rogue , he is rotten to the core , or as voight more appropriately says , he's a scumbag . i wonder how many critics who raved about this film because of cahill's winsome mannerisms , would still like this character if he robbed them . and that is the point of this slickly done , methodical film , that makes it impossible for me to fall for the story , i just don't care what happens to him . his life story bored me . i thought of him robbing houses in a miner's helmet , being a smooth cat burglar , as merely clever filmmaking , capturing what is sort of odd to watch , as this fat guy bounces around and is so agile . it was great casting , making gleeson the lead . but i still find nothing in his story that appeals to me about him . cahill is just a scumbag , and voight was right . in fact , the film could have been more interesting if it was about voight . i found him to be the more fascinating character in the story . sometimes just being ordinary , hides so much more about a person , and voight seemed to have heavy things on his mind , that might have been more interesting than following this dead-end , obvious tale . the robberies he pulls off we have seen done countless times before on film . so all the precision planning that goes into robbing the museum of all its valuable paintings , and the chase scenes via car or scooter , were all well done , but so what ! this film's theme has been done too many times for me to be carried away by such direction . i wanted something else from this film , but i didn't get it . what i got was a masterful performance , that i can't deny , from gleeson , and a director who can be magnificent in setting a playful confrontational tone with what he had to work with and letting the camera do its job . . . if i wasn't revolted by cahill as a criminal , i would be inclined to rate this film much higher . 
though , i gladly admit , i enjoyed viewing the unusual road scenes in the desolate brazilian countryside , where the people are poor , ignorant , superstitious , and craving for a religion that gives them some form of hope for their dismal lives . this former documentary film director , ably showed how religion can be as phony as the government that keeps most of the people impoverished . in any case , this was a place where tourists don't visit and films about this kind of brazil are rarely seen by a foreign audience . therefore , for me , the strongest point of the film is the documentary type of cinematography that went into the parched brazilian countryside , making the barren land throb with life . that was pure cinematic magic . a theme that has been done before , sometimes much better , as in landscape in the mist . the film emphasized the built-in misery the heroine has that made life for her to be a grind , but there seemed to be something special about her that the actress was able to bring out from her characterization that made her seem better than what she appeared to be . the beauty of this tale is not in the story itself , if there is a beauty in the tale , but in the way it affected the two main characters , dora and josue , as they eventually find something in themselves that they didn't know they had , and they learn how to deal with the bitternesss in their life . how much you like the film , depends on how believable you find the transformation that is about to take place for these characters . for me , it was too much sentimentality and an uninspiring and contrived plot that kept me from warming up to the story . that the woman being transformed from a spiteful person , who made fun of the letter writers and despised children , will become transfixed from an ugly duckling , mad at the world , to an almost angelic figure , someone capable of bringing great joy to the world , was too much for me to accept , all at once . the story turned out just too goody-goody for my taste . i do not trust films that are so contrived , there is something about them that remains phony , that good acting can only mask just so much of that phoniness . and the acting by montenegro was grand , she is the film , along with the fine cinematography , but even that , is not enough to completely overcome such a stale story . 
there is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste required when making a so-called comedy film about the holocaust , not to offend those who have suffered enough already , but that proves to be no problem here , as benigni went to some jewish organizations prior to shooting the film and got their blessings for this project . besides , i don't think there are any sacred subjects that can't be touched , it is , ultimately , the quality of the film itself that counts . and if there is another reason for not disapproving offhand the film's comic handling of this horrific context , then let's bring up the example of charlie chaplin in the the great dictator , though not directly about the holocaust , nevertheless , it was a light comedic parody of " the fuehrer " , and it was considered by many , not only to be an appropriate film , but one of the all time great films . the later part of the assessment of that film , is in recognition of that film's tremendous power to satirize nazism . benigni's film just can't muster that same power , because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too much , as well-intentioned , as he might have been in trying to tell the story , the power in the telling of it is just not there . what is there , are bits and pieces of the holocaust's human story , that is as horrific a story as any one can imagine , and offers some contribution to understanding the affects of the holocaust . what he just doesn't make clear , is that the italian fascists were part of the " final solution . " benigni's film offers no explanation for this . life is beautiful , is the line trotsky said , before he was about to be assassinated , serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject , that is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner , even though , what it offers for nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly anti-septic kind , reminding me of stalag 17 , or hogan's heroes tv series where the nazis are pictured as cartoon buffoons . having a horse painted green , marked as a jewish horse , makes for a colorful scene and segue to elopement for guido ( benigni ) and dora ( braschi ) , but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide . to find such truths , go way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle , which , instead , uses this serious subject matter for benigni to contrast his charlie chaplin like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous , while following a story line that will not try to offend anyone , probably not even the nazis , that much , especially since benigni calls this story a fable , giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film . let me tell you , the holocaust was no fable . but yet , because the subject matter is so deadly serious , he is , at least , able to reach a more general audience , drawn to see such a film they would have most likely not seen , but see it because of benigni's comic ability , and in the process , he has vouchsafed for them how insane the world's prejudice against jews has been , as he makes the film's efforts seem worthy enough , even if that were all this film would accomplish , that would be plenty . but i believe he does accomplish more , but he does it , by distorting history , until , in the end , he does show the horror and tragedy of the holocaust , in his own inimical way . in the first part of the film , if you did not know that benigni's guido was jewish , you certainly couldn't tell , since he just seemed like he was an eccentric , motor-mouth italian . so , in that sense , this film in a round-about way , is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might still have about jews being so different from others . i was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a concentration camp ; i also was not touched as i should have been with the gravity of the situation , due to the comic effects . and if any one in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a concentration camp they could survive , i got a surprise for them , it ain't so . the book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments , is the one by the italian chemist and former concentration survivor , primo levi , whose autobiographical , " i survived auschwitz , " shows what it really was like in those camps . that book touched me , even more than the truest film to date that i saw about the holocaust , shoah , did . after you read that book , there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park when you are interred in such a camp . though the italian jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp , because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering , nevertheless , it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead . the film is really made up of two parts , each with a very different feel to it . for most of this part of the film we don't even know if he is jewish , until we see the green horse and , later on , see the sign on his bookstore saying this is a jewish place , since he seems to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him . amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes , which probably never go out of style , since the audience where i watched the film , howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits , leaving me to wonder why i can't muster a laugh . there must be something funny about this physical humor , after all , there is a long line of vaudeville comedians who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks . i guess , this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea , and if others find it funny and because of it , find the film endearing , then it is just a question of differing tastes . though , quite frankly , i did think most of the bits were embarrassingly crass ; for instance , those contrived scenes where he keeps bumping into his future wife , and the switching of hats ; and , the egg- in- the- face routine , i found to be especially tedious , since i find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than outright funny . but , i also , must say , the first part of the film was easy to watch , it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it . it's too bad she can't act , but then again , this is basically a one man show , so really , she just becomes another one of his props , much like a leading lady in a marx bros . movie is used , as a diversion to balance their comedy routines . this material is shamelessly old hat , it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and manipulative on screen . but there were also some clever bits , like his speech , though not original , it still hit the mark , as he pretended to be a school official , giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary students where dora teaches , using his body as an example of all his superior fascist parts , such as his belly button , which is a good fascist one . this game idea could probably work for as long as a train ride from italy to germany , but for anyone to think it could work inside the camp , that would be ludicrous on their part to think so . the jews in the camp looked so well fed , that it was hard to believe that they were in a concentration camp . everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice that projected bad acting and because of that , almost made a mockery out of their roles . naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the camp , except for the bit where guido translates the rules of the camp for the german guards , as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is reading are the rules for the game they are playing , as he explains that the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game . no one laughed in the audience , but this was funny in a way that you wouldn't laugh out loud funny . some slapstick was tried , such as guido's comically high stepping walk , but that got no laughs . but mostly , for this part of the film , the emphasis became on this game he was playing for his kid's sake , his love was so great for him , that he would do anything to save his life . audiences could relate to that , and that cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film . that is primarily why this film won an oscar for best foreign film , its comedy alone would not have been enough . the film , to its ever lasting credit , was able to clearly depict jews as human beings , not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons , more human than the nazis , who have disqualified themselves from being a civilized regime by their inhumanity . this where i think life is beautful succeeded most , is being a film that inadvertly , without probably really being fully aware of what it was doing , showed how unprepared the jews were for this tragedy by being in a state of denial . which is one of the reasons why the holocaust is such a touchy subject , and one has to be careful about how one presents it to others , lest one forgets its dire consequences . and as unbelievable as it may seem , life is beautful , somehow or other , caught an interesting aspect of the holocaust , with an original take on how passive the jews were , something few films really make a major point of , for one reason or another . did the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide ? for some people it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of comedy and a holocaust . the uniqueness and likability of this film , is that benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very difficult situation , using comedy as a weapon . but this is most definetly an example of the rewriting of history , by seeing the holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite real , as a fable , depending on the audience itself to know fully well what happened , where only by the very end of the film , is there a realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be shed , does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the holocaust actually know about it . there is a reason why films are popular , and that reason is that people want to see what they like on screen , they as a rule , do not like to think about things that are unpleasant to them , and this film has deftly and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the horrible things they could have seen , instead , it subtly goes about its business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the jews in those camps by not showing how real their plight was . this film seemed almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a father's love for his family and his great sacrifice for them , rather than a holocaust film per se . that the world is still filled with hatred , filled with other genocide campaigns , and not filled with enough people throughout the world with enough courage to put a stop to this attitude , is as plain as day . i still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary scale and ready to do a nazi-style thing all over , if given the chance , just check out the recent serbian-kosovo conflict for affirmation that ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of nazism . so what can a film do ? probably , all it can do is show what really happened , and it doesn't matter if its method is drama , comedy , or even a musical , as long as it is meaningful . i intend to be very critically tolerant of this film and say , that even though it struck me as a rather thin holocaust story , it is still a worthwhile film for those who don't want or can't handle the heavier stuff , and are not put off by the comedy . they will find , if they look hard enough and look past what miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the oscar , a film that is more complex than it appears at first glance . but they will also find , that it is a film that still makes it evident , that the world still is in denial of what really happened , and can only look at the holocaust in a rather superficial way , even after all these years . there is still an element of world guilt , that because of that , will so highly reward this film with honors , even if the film has shown that it cannot open up both its eyes to see how real the holocaust was . but , i guess , we should thank benigni for at least opening up one eye , and letting us see that both his film's take on the holocaust and most of the world's take on the holocaust , is still bonded by denial about how they view the holocaust , which is the same mistake the italian jews made when they denied the obvious , what was right in front of their noses , until it was too late . 
the movie is very loosely adapted from soren kierkegaard's early treatise on beauty , infatuation and the power of intellectual persuasion . but the explicit sex is kept to the minimum ; instead , it uses the need to find romance as a form of irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness . it pretends to be supportive of philosophy and its intrinsic intellectual powers that society has very little value for , but does not move the film in that direction . instead , it opts for light comedy . the chemistry is much better between sebastien and anne , a match that no one can possibly believe should be taking place , but is funny to watch as the opinionated and pushy sebastien operates his inane charm on the sophisticated and attractive older woman , until she nearly makes a complete fool of herself . with all these characters and precarious situations abounding , the movie still had a flatness to it , though , admittedly , in some spots the craziness of the characters was hilarious . the flatness is derived from some spark that is missing from the film . as for me , i wasn't taken with the main character , gregoire , and therefore , had little interest in his strange love affair and his affixation with magic . the story itself was weakened by its not being developed further . it seemed to be thrown together as if it were a series of comedy skits . the film did have a good sense of tongue-in-cheek humor , keeping it lighthearted . but for a film about a book a great philosopher wrote , not to be thoughtful , is in my humble opinion , only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a philistine way . 
e . j . an unconscionable clinker for those who are more impressed with intellect in films than with special effects , for a film costing 200 million dollars to make , while doing a dutiful job in recreating the grandeur of the ship and its ritzy atmosphere , but failing in everything else , except in the gall to think it has created a masterpiece . if there is anyone out there who stills believes there is such a thing as an unsinkable ship , you'll believe leonardo dicaprio's innocuous portrayal of an artist on board the ill-fated ship and that the soap opera story told is tantamount to a work of art . films backed by big money like this one , rarely ever go after controversy , much preferring to steer a trouble-free course , with a clever eye to the bottom line . i think any actress on board that ship could have played that part . it is hard to believe how trite and contrived this story was , and how everyone in this film had no depth of character . everyone was a wooden stereotype of what their class status was supposed to be like . what gave this film watch ability , was the way the ship was recreated down to its last details , giving one the romantic feeling that one was on the real voyage . at least , the money spent for visual effects went to some good usage . what was ultimately unforeseen , was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs , which the ship rammed into at full speed . the photography was great . the costumes were terrific . the sound system was as good as it gets . everything about the special effects was first-class . if you judge a film by those standards , then you will be more than pleased with this film . if you are looking for a cruise into deeper water , then i'm afraid you boarded the wrong film , this one will only leak all over you . i waited a long time to see this film , choosing to watch it on tv and not on a big screen theater ; i have no regrets why i waited so long . by the way , i saw a night to remember ( 1958 ) , and thought that version of the titanic to be just grand , not cluttered with a trivial story , just sticking to the suspense of the historical event , which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards . 
after a brilliant , stylish opening sequence , this film begins to unravel and by the time it ends , it is a misfire . cage and sinise play well off each other : sinise reserved ( just right for the part ) , cage frenetic ( over - emoting but still very effective ) . assassination taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done , and well worth the price of admission , as de palma goes crazy with his cameras offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the casino . we soon learn who the villains are , so the picture that so brilliantly set - up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as : loyalty , corruption , sense of duty , patriotism , and one's own personal dilemmas begins to go off in another direction , in the direction of where the film - makers think it can draw in the box office crowds , that is , it turns into a flat action movie , where things are easily predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the characters . the camera is the only star of this film . in the end , this became a very annoying picture that promised so much and only delivered what could be best described , as superficial entertainment . 
this version of browning's poem is well-told and sensible , and probably a lot like he meant it to be conveyed , but somehow it looks flat on screen , like it was a b movie , and this is surprising , since demy is really a great director . but , evidently , something went terribly wrong here . the film is so flatly done , it was as if i was watching the machine-like actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling story , that when it came out on screen had lost its chills , even if the story itself remained chilling . 
the stars of the film , who play a married couple , are probably playing out on screen a lot of what their married life was like before their real-life divorce . this film has both the look of a daytime tv soaper and a cheapie movie . i can't begin to explain why he does that , unless he is so arrogant and bored with life that he feels he has to do it . i found enough interest in this film to say that it is not completely without merit , but i did not think it told a crisp enough story to make it anything but one of chabrol's experimental so-so films . for the film to say , that men always ask questions and women don't , is not exactly a modern attitude to have these days , and it was unclear to me what chabrol's thinking about this really was , whether it was an ironical attitude or a stab at saying something that was so ridiculous that no one could take it seriously . chabrol has made a career out of being vague in his films , and more often than not it has worked to his benefit , but not this time . 
at other times , the film drifts off into soapy sentimental territory , becoming contrived and not sure if it wants to be that honest and truthful about the bitter-sweet story it is telling . it is a movie made by ealing , a british studio , that actually used mostly a british cast , making the film seem more british than aussie . it is a film that disney could have easily made ; and , it should be noted that this film was made into a successful television sitcom . 
he is self-serving , he presents here a bitter picture about romance , but he mainly pokes fun at either himself or his fictionalized-self , going through his wide range of jokebook material on jewish neurotics , that is sometimes devilishly funny , sometimes as flat as matzoh , and sometimes done in just plain bad taste . this ill-conceived film has its funny moments , if one can get through woody's hubris and his putz-like mannerisms , that have a way of zinging you , as if you were around a schmuck who couldn't stop , even for a second from being who he is . but when i have given up all hope for this muddled mish-mash to amount to anything worthwhile , the " putz " gets off some acidly perceptive comments that go straight to the laugh belly . so what are you gonna say ? this is a woody allen movie , it is how he operates best , and this one ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre . there are many stars that have cameos , and it works out well , they just do their routines and fit right into this rambling story , especially since it is safe to say that this is not a plot driven movie , in fact , the plot is incidental to the movie , if there wasn't a plot this would still be a movie about the neurotic behavior of mr . allen . so i find it unnecessary to try and explain the plot fully , except to say that woody writes books , using material from his marriages , with the movie going back and forth between woody and his real life situation and the characters he has in his book being played by different actors , for instance richard benjamin is the woody allen character harry , but with still a different name from that of the book . all the characters in his books are thinly disguised representatives of his real life movie situation . the film is worth seeing for woody's acerbic one-liners ; such as : all religions are just clubs . tradition is the illusion of permanence . you are the opposite of a paranoid-- you actually believe that people like you . and there are numerous other wise-cracks , that hit the right spot . so what's the big deal if the story is not so hot , and woody is a selfish-lout , don't kvetch , enjoy yourself , you don't have to be a nihilist to get a few yuks from this film . 
this is a time of great change and upheaval in berlin , and there is an international flavor in the air , as culture is moving in that direction . therefore there are great changes in the way people relate to others . as far as the nazis , their hatred is very apparent and very gripping across all levels of society during this time . this film takes , in my opinion , an erroneous view of their activity , soft peddling it , and stating that it was only among the lower classes that anti-semitism was prevalent , that the upper classes and the cultured classes were generally supportive of the jews . this is just not true . it is a rewriting of history that is not based on the facts . that is just ignoring the truly horrible and pervasive nazi reign of terror , that really didn't go into full blast until kristallnacht in '38 , but was certainly more wide-spread in the early 30s than what was portrayed here . it should also be noted that streicher was executed as a nazi war criminal as a result of the nuremberg trials . is a crush of people surging onstage to give them warm support and encouragement . there was something emotionally flat and unconvincing about this story , that not only rubbed me the wrong way , but made me think how apologetic the filmmaker was to the real events of history , as he tried to force feed the audience into believing so many untruths about what actually took place , that it is hard for me to say that this film made up for its distorted history lessons with its pleasing music and cabaret-like mood its splendid cinematography presented . its call for the world to be less nationalistic and more global minded , had a pleasing ring to it , but that is simply not enough to counter how tame the film appears as a whole , as the story does not dig deep enough into the real events ; and , also , the characters are only superficially dealt with , despite the terrific performances , so that the love story and all the different personality clashes seem to be glossed over , not making me feel involved with them as much as i should be . leaving me with the impression that i was seeing a good looking and sounding film , but one that did not ultimately satisfy my need to feel that germany has learned its lesson from its most pernicious period of history , as it fails to answer the question , how can such a cultured people accept the atrocities of the nazis so willingly . 
another film skewed for tarantino enthusiasts , and this one is just as conversationally maddening , filled with vulgarities and street talk , but no sex . it pays to be the first one on your block to do it , because imitation is always second-hand stuff , and this film has the feel of something already done by many other copy-cats . but it was a funny movie , in a perverted way , even if the story line just didn't add up . when you hear the reason why they did this , you'll know for sure that this film doesn't make sense . this is peter o'fallon's feature film debut , as he chugs out all the slickness he could muster to make this film seem like its happening , including glittering credits that seem to be dancing on the screen . but it also could refer to the ill-advised nature of the mission the boys are on , because what they are doing is surely suicidal . his encounter with the dopey kidnappers of lisa , shows how he goes about his business , pulling the film into the gangster genre for a few minutes before going back to its satire of that genre . this is done while the boys are playing poker , and it passes for about as much wisdom as you are going to take away from this well-acted , dark comedy/suspense film , that is absolutely ridiculous , but it is entertaining as escapist-fare . there is one more priceless pearl of wisdom dished out , that i feel should be mentioned , because it highlights the confusing messages the film sends out , it was also uttered by charlie during his confinement , and for no particular reason it made me laugh aloud-- " everybody lies : but word on the street , that's solid . " this film is anything but solid , but it had a weird flavor to it , that sometimes seemed natural and other times forced . but the performances of walken and leary , kept me in this one , sometimes wondering what's the story with this film . 
certain people just never have any luck . ( can a russian film be anything but ponderous ? ) the strength of this symbolical film , is in the way the director pavel chukhrai , is able to explicitly show the harshness of the stalin years as it infected the daily life of its citizens . the the weakness of the film , is that it is really not drama , but soap opera , that is convincingly done through the powerful persona that mashkov , a russian stage actor and romantic star of cinema , is able to evoke from his strong performance , who is cruel and capable of being loved at the same time . but the story seems contrived , it just flows too neatly together without having an energy of its own . the story is just too pat to be that effective , except as a curious look at what the russians themselves thought of stalin and how they functioned under his regime during the '50s . 
mindless adventure takes hold , and the story becomes implausible and unimportant . an effort was made to provide a crisp dialogue , as mamet , was supposedly the richard weisz , who is mentioned in the credits as the story writer . it was wise of mamet for not displaying his own name . yet there is a sprinkling of good lines and humor , here and there , enough to make the film mildly diverting , if you are into watching this film for something else besides the action scenes . but despite some attempts to make this a deeper than usual actioner , frankenheimer's film is just your typical actioner . what gives it a lift and a sense of being something more than the thin story it really is , is the beautiful camera work and moody colors of the cinematography ; and , the superb acting by a very capable cast . without de niro's presence this film would have been less than a run-of-the-mill action film , despite its excellent cinematography . i also found that pryce and skarsgard stood out in their villain roles . and katrina witt was a welcome relief from all the hard action scenes . it didn't make sense ; but , then again , nothing really made sense in this film . i admired his manchurian candidate ( 62 ) and french connection 11 ( 75 ) for the raw power of their stories and their keen insights into his characters' behavior . unfortunately , this film is not of the same caliber . it fails to make us think that what is taking place is anything but absurd ; and , that is the shame of it . this once great filmmaker , in his prime , always seemed to provide us with both thoughtful and suspenseful films that had some depth to them ; while this film , is at best , only mildly diverting . 
film brings out a collection of philosophers to state its case ; such as , sartre , kierkegaard , nietzsche , and heidegger . this was a mistake . you are comparing apples with oranges , and the film suffers with its credibility from such an unjust comparison . in case ferrara forgot , vampires are not real but the holocaust was only too real . the film itself , does not feature much action , relying on a lot of chatter and non-communicative conversations to get its story across . she thanks them for coming , and then says , `i'd like to take a minute to share with you a little of what i've learned while studying for my doctorate . ' now that's what we were waiting for , since the film did not feel quite right up to that point . it felt better being more campy . despite the short-comings of the plot , lili taylor gives a credible performance . this thinking man's vampire movie , is a natural for the midnight cult audience , but will seem out of place in a prime time slot . christopher walken is a natural for this type of film , but has a part that might as well be nonexistent . we don't see him until the film is nearly over , and when we do see him , he doesn't do much , except drain the blood of the still-not-evolved vampire , kathy . one of the many problems with this low-budgeter , is that it couldn't tell its story without the philosophers . it needs their explanations to explain itself . the story , which could have been more interesting if developed properly , never has a chance to really express itself without being explained away in philosophical terms . all its weird subjects are brazenly brought up and we are teased with the weight of their meaning , and then we are stopped short from following through on what their implications are . for instance , the topic of free will , always a good philosophical one ; but , when kathy says it is now my will against theirs , we are not quite sure what she means by that . but what does that mean . unless this is a blatant call against pacifism , saying we have to get ready to kick ass whenever we are set-upon . the film's theme becomes , that existence itself is the search for relief from our habits , and existence is the only relief we can find from our habits that makes sense . so the question becomes , what should we do , if we can't kill what is dead . . . you and if you are faced with choosing you or them , jumping or being pushed , kathy still believes that you must satisfy your own needs first . or , you can do with as little as you possibly can , says the diet-conscious and wise vampire , peina . if you want to see a film that is more credible than this one , that handles the same subject , but injects more life and fear into its story , and less philosophy and guilt-ridden religious themes , check out larry fessenden's habit . 
an inanely delightful and slickly done and predictable escapist film , based on an actual hostage situation in st . louis . this gives danny a chance to match wits with sabian , and the two stellar actors take it from there . the only thing the story surprisingly lacked was an intelligent dialogue , though the story itself often took the high road as it was presented in a reasonably intelligent manner . it didn't stoop to gratuitous violence and seemed to be trying to say something about the proper procedures to follow in a hostage situation . it's all routine-fare , with hardly any surprises , a stylish and carefully orchestrated film , challenging what the concepts of loyalty among colleagues and friends means when things go wrong , and how well you really know someone that you have been friends with , even if it is as long as 20 years . the cast includes david morse , in a robotic role as s . w . a . t . it is directed with a certain air of incredulousness by f . gary gray , who seems to make light of the fact that danny had to take hostages to prove his point . the film moves along at a quick pace , interrupted by valid action scenes from time-to-time , allowing the film to be an easy watch for those who are not that demanding of a storyline but prefer instead good action sequences . this glossy run-of-the mill action film should be very successful on its video rental trade , as it is a visually pleasing film , with a happy ending to boot , and nothing symbolic in it to tax your brain . just about right for the market it is geared to . 
though the film subtly is weighted in favor on the feminist side of the question , it still for most of the film chooses , instead , to overtly attack both sides for caring only about their opinions and not about the individual . since the film will not offer its opinion about what to do with this not so nice or redeemable idler , but chooses to show its fairness by unfairly attacking both sides of the abortion argument . this leaves us wondering how much the filmmaker really cared about ruth . so it doesn't really surprise me that a film tackling a taboo political subject should be so cautious and centrist in its views . but what bothers me , is that this film came on pretending to be hip to the problems of the homeless . norm echoes all the obnoxious slogans and dogmas and hypocrisies of his fundamental christian beliefs . everyone in the film is stereotyped : the pro-lifers are republicans , religious fanatics , family value people , sexually repressed , drivers of station wagons , and self-righteous . the pro-choicers are democrats , lesbians , pagan worshippers , those with loose morals , without god , and insincere . again , the arguments against both sides is handled in an even-handed manner . both leaders are viewed as hypocrites . the only thing that can save this film from its cautious stand , is what you thought of dern's performance . and that is the rub against the picture , it can't get beyond the absurd nature of its satire , as everyone in the film remains a cartoon figure . so the outcome should come as no particular surprise . could this really be payne's idea of how to resolve the issue ? as for dern's grating and , at times , just too much of an annoying performance , it failed to evoke concern for her plight . by the film's end she still appeared to be white-trash , to be laughed at and dismissed as being someone society can't help . the entire film's satire was a futile effort at comedy . it's weak position on the issues allowed it to throw stones at everyone and seem like it was hip to what was going on , but in reality it changed no one's mind about abortion ; and , in the bargain , it wasn't a particularly funny film . 
he ends up stealing the film with his energetic comical rendition of a buffoon . this character has always been considered one of shakespeare's best comedy roles . love in this fairyland setting has more to do with chance than anything else since it is blind . the mix-ups that follow puck's interference , create new difficulties and allow for the lovers to be manipulated and mismatched by puck's magic . shakespeare's magic wasn't working ; and , i think that was because an hour or so of the play's dialogue was lopped off , making this three hour play into a two hour movie . the consequences are that the characters couldn't be fully developed ; in fact , the film had a flatness to it that belied how good its lush cinematography made it look . instead of character development , we got rolls in the mud to convey the deep feelings of how the young lovers felt about the confusion puck's love potions had on them . too dumb down shakespeare even further , there were times when the director used obvious facial gestures by the characters to let us in on how to react to what they were doing . this is sort of like the canned responses for those tv shows , where a sign is held up to let the audience know when to applaud . what was eloquent about the film , that made it a passable viewing experience , was due to the superb cast , a mixture of true shakespearian british actors ; such as , anna friel , christian bale , and dominic west , and the feisty non-shakespearian actors , calista flockhart , stanley tucci , rupert everett and michelle pfeiffer . then there was the stirring use of verdi's greatest operatic hits throughout the film , which fitted conveniently in with the director's 19th century italian theme . this is a clever film ; it is much better than the scores of amateur stage productions that continually flood the country . but the director made a lot of odd choices in this film that take away somewhat from the magical feeling of the play and make it seem artificial , or more of a commercial venture than it should be . there was no artistic reason to be in 19th century italy , except for its rich landscapes and colorful costumes and beautiful villas shown . also , the flatness and clumsiness of the fairyland scenes when juxtaposed against the lively actor's troupe , made this film seem uneven , even begging us to utter with conviction the bard's choice words : " what fools these mortals be . " 
this biting family drama hones in on the anxieties and turbulence a dysfunctional modern french family experiences , eventually uncovering all their unhappiness , but not much else is offered as for plot surprises . jean-pierre darroussin , the self-effacing waiter , denis , was reading during the show . film student , who has a knack for making wry observations regarding relationships . this realistic film is based on a play written by two of the actors here , ms . jaoui and jean-pierre bacri . in fact , this entire ensemble cast also acted in the play . she explains henri's dour disposition and lack of ambition away , with the ridiculous comment that she knew he would amount to nothing because he was a late walker . all this becomes tedious after awhile , though i'm sure it accurately portrays how some bourgeoisie families are . what i was waiting to see happen , was something momentous or inspiring , but that never really occurred . instead , what happened was that this drama went on cruise control , with a functional dialogue and characters who really did seem to resemble each other after awhile . the basic plot revolved around the problems the children have . nonetheless , this was a somewhat satisfying if not too sobering of a film experience . it really is a film that can't stop being a play , and to its detriment it can't do anything to alter that structure . it is through small changes in character development that the film succeeds best . and isn't that the way it is in real life ? this claustrophobic production , done in real time over the course of one evening , understands that . it did offer one scene , in particular , that caught my fancy . when yo-yo was given her birthday presents , it was fun to see who gave her what . this was the funniest moment in the film , and it did seem to give the characters renewed wind to charge into its final moments . the film's bleakness was somewhat lessened when we see the bookish denis and the outspoken betty riding off together on a motor scooter , hopefully to live together happily ever after . as the simple yo-yo commented on seeing that friendship , she's lucky to have such a nice guy . it seems everyone but the snobbishly recalcitrant and ever nagging mother learned a little something this evening about themselves . 
an enjoyable b- movie but not quite as good as its reputation suggests it would be . if you can suspend critical judgment regarding the thinness of the story and the robotic acting and taut dialogue that should have been made funnier instead of playing it so straight , then you should be in a receptive mood for what the 1950s took for schlock cyberspace . we are in the prime time of hardened cold war attitudes , which are bristling with military solutions and a case of good old paranoia to keep us on our toes . so what better or easier target for all our pent up anxieties , than for the martians to be the bad guys . now there might be just as many people in this country who believe in flying saucers as there are who don't , so when we see a flying saucer land in someone's backyard and disappear in the ground , the film is on familiar sci-fi turf . in this cheapie production , he makes the most of the sets he created , and in the final battle scenes between the army and the martians , they look good enough to add a certain amount of necessary chills to the film . anyway , life on mars doesn't seem so hot , so why not come to america the land of opportunuty , a haven for those seeking a better life . the only thing serious about this movie , is that it was done in a serious manner . aside from that , it's a harmless tingler with enough thrills in it to make it pleasantly watchable . it is one of those movies where you can find enough in it to think it wasn't so bad ; and , it really wasn't so bad when you come to think about it . the most interesting part of it , is that it gives you a clear view of 1950s attitudes . it reflected a time that was much different from the way things are now : parents spoke to their children in a respectful manner and vice versa , there was a na ? vet ? in its political concerns , and it idealized the small town concepts of america . there are many old-timers who wish america could return to those simpler times . . . even though those times had masked the bigger problems they couldn't face , the problems that blew up in the '60s and changed the language and attitudes of the country . this film was made 46 years ago but seems as if it came from a nostalgic time that will never be with us again . it is worth seeing mainly for those reasons . 
a fine looking , but extremely lightweight satire from tom dicillo ( living in oblivion , box of moonlight ) . i could not take this satirical comedy as a serious work of satire , as the story is rife with unresolved issues it brings up just to be seemingly ironical but with not enough conviction or intensity of purpose to make something out of its mocking tone , that is attacking both the television and fashion industry . all the characters are busy pursuing their goals to succeed in the image-oriented fashion industry or in the cheesy video and tv soap opera markets of new york . unfortunately , the satire has little bite to it . dicillo couldn't make up his mind what he wanted to do , so the characters end up as being viewed as satires of themselves . i'm sure no one in the " industry " is going to be too taken aback by this film's attack on them . but the audience will see a well crafted film , that is pleasant to watch , but with hardly any laughs to garner from it . their story is what is supposed to tug at our heart strings and also make us laugh , as they try and handle all the obstacles they are up against . this seems to make them out to be more real than bob and sahara ; at least , in their eyes . it succeeded in telling their side of the story . the only thing is that their story was not that different from those who were depicted as being superficial . this was especially amusing because joe had to betray all his lofty views just to get this vulgar job , before losing it because he mouths off to an ignorant assistant director . but all the film added up to , was an easy to watch , slick nyc life-style satirical story about those trying to make it in the glamor business , told by an interesting director who tried to say something more than what was actually said . 
to go back and see what that city is like now , should be interesting , especially since there is very little media coverage of saigon that reaches main street america . this rather sentimental elegy to his country , plays much like a travelogue , bent on painting a pretty picture of the country despite the sad tale it tells of four diverse , gentle souls , whose symbolic fictionalized venture will prove to be very touching , as we follow them around saigon and observe them as their lives sometimes interact with each other . what the film lacks is a real poet's cutting edge and tension , and what is also astonishingly absent , is a view of the political situation . but what is even more astonishing , is the complete lack of anger from those who are poor , whose lives are so polarized from the very rich . there is little risk taken here by the director , who has shot a purposefully fictionalized account of vietnam , showing only that it is being swallowed up by capitalism and its own passivity . the coca-cola signs and the luxurious hotels serve only as reminders that this country is being overtaken by commercialism and greed , nevertheless the director seems content to film his picturesque view of the city , as is , of these materialistic intrusions appearing without any kind of analysis as to why . the pastel colors of the film and the brightness of the city , allow even the squalid slum section of town to appear to be picture perfect . another symbolic message , this time relating to their country and how it must learn to love itself without being gobbled up by foreigners . the season is summer and it is extremely hot . everything gets tidied up in nice little packages by the film's end and every one walks away enchanted , and this very picturesque take on saigon , that seems to be a love affair the director is having with his ancestral country , turns out to be an irksome charmer to behold . it lacks what it thinks it has : poetic vision . there is not much substance in its lyrics , and its beauty can only be taken as skin deep . when we think about what this film was saying , there is not much there that is perceptive enough to add something worthwhile to its lugubrious tale . the plain truth is , that there was just nothing striking said during this well-crafted film to hold our attention . it was mostly an arty kind of mush , fed to a western audience that is dying to see something nice about vietnam , even if that something can't get past being sentimental jive . the clich ? d story had too many coincidences and improbabilities in it , and an incomplete picture of how this city now functions , for its story to be considered as being relevant to the topic it covered , except by those who are pleased and willing to see something about vietnam that lets them forget about the war and the terrible conflicts it brought to both countries . 
a typical 1950s noir , distinguished by its rapid pace and taut script , that delves mainly into the character of the villain-- making him out to be someone who went over-the-edge when he couldn't take being ridiculed as a failure , anymore . by being nearly blind and wearing thick glasses for his myopia , he assumes the role of a victim in society , visually manifesting a pathos based on this physical handicap . this the suburban atmosphere and the no nonsense style of telling the story , are a stark contrast to the suspense building up for the very characteristic 1950s couple . the blandness of the story and the failure to elicit anything out of the ordinary , play against the competence of this well-crafted script . the result is a watchable film , which could be seen for the sense of nostalgia it evokes to a more receptive time for noir to work as well as it does . 
a wonderfully hokey b-movie , that is a derivative thriller from the director with all the gimmicks , william castle ( tingler ) . here he uses a fright-clock on screen , giving those audience members who are too frightened to see the scary conclusion , a chance to leave the theater . we don't have showmen like castle around anymore , instead we got corporate executive types running the studios , looking only at the bottom line . they have taken the fun out of promoting a movie and have made it just another stale business marketing venture . castle also effectively features in homicidal a lot of copycat things from other films , such as the psychotic mannerisms of the killer , which was lifted straight out of psycho . that the story makes absolutely no sense and has more holes in it than swiss cheese , is besides the point . it's obvious that he will grow up to be a sick one . the pyscho-dynamics of this twisted yarn , as they unfold , are a real hoot to watch . emily and warren ( jean arless ) speak in unnatural stilted tones , while karl and miriam go out together and are so sugary sweet that one could hyperventilate by just watching them . homicidal is a classical horror film , but featuring mediocre acting and plot ; its one gigantic plus is the interesting characterization by jean arless , who seems to be swimming in a different stream than the rest of the cast . the ending is predictable but fun to watch , and for that matter , this shamelessly exploitative film is a total gas . castle himself introduces the film , and thereby gets you in the right mood to see this shocker . if you are in the proper humor for a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously , you have nothing to lose by seeing it , which is the attitude the bellboy had when he mumbled just those sentiments to himself before accepting the bizarre marriage proposal offered him by the seemingly attractive blonde . this is the kind of film that defies critical analysis , if you're in the mood for schlock-shock , this could be a most entertaining film . 
this social comedy is a slick sick one , told in short sketches , where absurdity and perversity go hand-in-hand with the dress , which is the subject of the film . the fashion designer of this plain summer dress is a pervert with a pig fetish , and to add insult to injury , it is worn by losers who are taken in by its optimistic design and colors . on the dresses journey , it brought bad luck to whomever owned it , passing to different ownership many times ; the film could have gone on ad infinitum , if the director wasn't kind enough to end the film with a good old mercy killing of it . but by making it just an object , giving it no other symbolic significance , the film has to rely on its biting satiric humor to carry it through . and since , i couldn't find myself consistently laughing at its monthy python-like skits , nor find its outrageous humor and politically incorrect stands to be paricularly tasteful , i therefore found myself under-whelmed with this third film by the independent cult film director , even as i empathize with his determination to make his own type of film , no matter how it is perceived by others . this bawdy comedy , should guarantee it some audience abroad , though those seeing it in the netherlands , have an added plus going for them , as they should be more able to recognize the cameos that some of the notable dutch film stars make in it . this was the most risque and politically incorrect scene in the film , but it also turned out to be a rather tame but funny scene , after all . but the humor came at the expense of the pathetic lady being chased by the rapist , who when in trouble would shout out , " i'm normal . " this rape scene was crasser than the other one , for a few moments it had the same hard edge of violence to it that a film like " funny games " had . since i was not all that amused by what i saw and did not find the film particularly perceptive , and only found parts of the film to be diverting and original , it is hard for me to recommend it as anything but an attempt to be outrageously funny without enough substance in it to be funny for a long enough period of time to be a fully entertaining movie . and it is only from an entertainment perspective , i think , that this film should be judged . 
why he doesn't turn the head over to the police , the most logical thing in the world to do , is never fully explained to my satisfaction . all this spy business was rather vaguely done , and gave no particular credence to the story , except it did show a large vacuousness among the young as to their country's recent history . what the film couldn't do , was make all this interesting and tangible to the story it was telling . a story which threw out many possible situations , but never delved fully into them . yet it was somewhat diverting as a study of the students and their attitudes . the naive hero is not convincing enough in his role as a seeker of justice and the film as a political thriller suffers from a lack of focused direction . it was a good idea for a film , that tried to show that metaphorically opposites might attract but can't stay together , but it was too poorly executed for one to sustain an interest in its long drawn out meandering story . 
this original youth film , that has the look of a pseudo-documentary but is a work of fiction , with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing mid-scene from reading a script to doing ad-libs , fails to answer the simple questions i put to it about what it is trying to accomplish . this is director and writer , harmony korine's ( screenwriter for kids ) , debut film as a director , accomplished with all the verve and necessary shock and schlock he can muster . what results is a pointless but engaging romp through a midwestern fictional suburban city , xenia , ohio , and its dysfunctional inhabitants , mostly white redneck youth , who either seem retarded or prone to violence , as they are searching for something to do with themselves in a city still suffering from the devastations of a tornado . korine is non-judgmental about any of his characters . but is that necessarily a good thing ? what saves this film from being a complete absurdity , is the raw energy exhibited by the director , as he is on the cutting edge of cinema verite , showing the pent-up hostility and alienation these trashy young people have . he seems to be painting his words with images of the most freakish things you can see in america's wasteland , and not caring whether you believe what you are seeing or not--his aim seems to be to shock the audience and for the audience to respond and say how " hip " he is to be showing us all these revolting and boring images . but is that enough to make this a satisfactory film ? two skin head teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride . but by showing all these freaks , is the director not just using them without any purpose but to exploit their oddness ? is this funny scene a comment on single-moms ? the film has an attention disorder disturbance of its own , as it keeps going at random from one vignette to another , without any deciferable plot or storyline , which should be a real treat for heavy metal enthusiasts with low attention spans and those who respect the personal creative nature of film and can overcome the depravity of what they are seeing and its immature fixations , and be impressed with the film's originality . for those lucky souls , they have found a film that is a rarity . but have they found a good film ? others who might like this film , could be taken in by the audaciousness of the director's style and the fast-pace of the film and its easy disposable use of images . but to its credit , the film does capture some of the fears the youths have about growing up and it does show that there are no role models around to help the children . but does the filmmaker really care about what he is seeing ? this film will probably be viewed as one that you either hate or love , and no one can convince you otherwise . since i was caught being in a voyeuristic mode by some of the film , then found myself tuning it out as i became bored with it ; i , therefore , can only say that the film did not work for me . it is hard for me to warm up to those who kill cats , yet i wanted to see how the minds of such people work . that i found out . which is the problem i had with watching the film , as i felt that i didn't need a mind to see it . this film lacked the needed pathos to make the youngsters' story seem more than a provocative freak show ; it failed to offer some meaning to their life , which resulted in giving the film a disjointed look , even though korine should be applauded for sticking to his personal vision . but , the final question is , do you think the director is really interested in showing us anything but a freak show ? 
a most improbable but engaging romantic mystery that holds our attention and teases our sensibilities . there are signs that what is happening to the two lovers is getting to be heavy , and what seems to be is not exactly what is . the storyline is awkward , melodramatic and incredulous , and the ending is somewhat ludicrous and overplayed , but what becomes interesting is the psychological games played by the couple . the basque director/writer has created a story with enough twists in it to keep you guessing at what will happen next , but the film left me with a bitter-sweet reaction to the romance . 
in the film version the hero succumbs to all the violence around him and gets his revenge , as by the film's end he happily wins a fist fight from his nemesis . everything that could be wrong about this school is wrong with it , as the classroom teachers , the brothers , all have crosses dangling from their robes , as if to remind the viewer that religion was something no one in this school believed in anymore , it was just something to be worn for show . it is so perverse a place , that there seems to be no way to function in it without selling your soul . the acting is superb . the story is gloomy and perceptive . there seems to be no real voice of reason . the heroes are too dull and without any real conviction to fight these fascists they are up against . all-in-all , a pretty disgusting lot , which makes this film a tough watch , with not enough elasticity to its story than to be more than a coming-of-age film that ultimately brings up the wrong lesson in life to learn : that it is sometimes better to conform than to rebel . the film itself lacked any sustaining energy to show that it really cared about the enemy it was fighting . it looked like it was too in love with the evil elite being depicted and invested too much in their presence to properly distance themselves from them and tell the story of the resistance fighter , like it needed to be told . 
therefore the film chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kid's gift , going almost exclusively for his father's nightmarish visions to tell its tale . as a result , the lesson being becomes : never play mind games you don't understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who has you under their power . though , at times , the story is close to losing it , getting enveloped in melodramatics , it manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems , keeping the film suspenseful , allowing you to overlook if you care to , the many holes in the story . the film just lost control of what it had going for it that made it different from , let's say , another recent ghost film , the sixth sense , and plummeted it back into the world of the run-of-the mill films of that genre . it is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are stunningly creepy . it also captures in its sights the good , bad , and ugly of chicago . this fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of its working class neighborhood completely , and by being grounded with this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective . >from this character driven film , we learn that ghosts get angry when we don't respond to them properly . that the afterworld is a place that some of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do , we better learn how to listen . kevin bacon plays the role convincingly , with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension , coming close but never going over the top , like a lesser actor might have been tempted to do . zachary david cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it , playing his role as well as could be expected . but i did have some problems that what was happening to him was not more fully developed . i felt i didn't really know much more about him by the film's end than from its beginning . in both sequences ghosts are communicating with him . i just had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift , and that even though they were hard working and nice people , they were not a very perceptive couple . what transpires is an ok ghost story , a suspenseful story of an ordinary couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for , and a weak murder story , that ruins the film , as it brings it down to earth in a most desultory manner . is the film worth seeing ? yes . it is entertaining and spooky , and you get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride . no . it is earthbound and contrived , and the ending is a stinker . take your pick , both answers are correct . 
ridicule ( director : patrice leconte ; screenwriters : remi waterhouse/eric vicaut/michel fessler ; cinematographer : thierry arbogast ; cast : charles berling ( baron gregoire ponceludon de malavoy ) , jean rochefort ( marquis de bellegarde ) , fanny ardant ( madame de blayac ) , judith godreche ( mathilde de bellegarde ) , bernard giraudeau ( abbot de vilecourt ) , urbain cancelier ( louis xvi ) , 1996-fr . ) for a film that prides itself on its use of wit to show what the nobility and their king louis xv1 were like during 1783 , just before the infamous french revolution , i would have expected to be more than dazzled by these nobles with their silver-tongued wit , cutting each other to bits and pieces with their razor-sharpened retorts . instead , i found myself more taken with the history aspect of this good looking costume spectacle and was not especially amused by the barbs . in fact , i found the film rather anti-septic , not a particularly moving dramatic experience . overrated by some of the critics , who seemed to fall for this french film's farcical intentions , deeming it intellectual in the broadest sense of what is intellectual , while failing to construe how ordinary and dispassionate the characters were . part fiction and part history , this satire , as directed by patrice leconte ( monsieur hire/the hairdresser's wife ) , is not completely absorbing in its romantic tale or as drama . the history part seemed to be accurate enough , depicting the corruption of the king's court and his placement of more importance on vacuous wit than genuine ideas . he thinks ponceludon might have some chance of succeeding in being witty and offers him lessons of how to survive in versailles , such as , " don't laugh at your own jokes and never laugh with your mouth open " , " call puns the death of wit " ; and remember , " the soul of wit is to know one's place . " what elevates this film above merely showing how obviously stupid and petty the nobles were , is that it stresses how the nobles had to use language to survive in that atmosphere . this film is also about a moral dilemma for our good-hearted hero . he must choose either what is morally correct or to sell himself out for his project , which he considers as something that is more important than how he might be perceived . the acting or the story did not excite me enough to think that this clever film was anything special , except as a mildly diverting farce , which could be , at best , considered only as a film that had its moments of being a clever satire . but mostly , it is a predictable french farce , with enough one-dimensional characters in it to fill the court of versailles with retorts that would pale next to those heard in an average schoolyard in urban america on a daily basis . 
alan ( trouble in mind , choose me , moderns ) rudolph's off-beat film has the look and feel of bad melodrama , using over-exaggerated action sequences to spin a convoluted yarn ( maybe a parody ) about twins , born to a ballerina who had an affair with a european aristocrat and is forced into giving them up for adoption when he wants no part of her . the title of the film , as defined , will refer to the equality of the light and dark sides during an equinox . she weaves this ambiguous tale or spoof , or whatever it is , together . as all the quirky characters will somehow fit into the story and by the end of the film , i guess , there is supposed to be some hidden message as henry stands alone , looking down at the tremendous depths of the grand canyon . there was one stupid line she said to him that made me laugh primarily because it was so stupid , " you're not going to catch nothing from me but your breath . " in fact , the only enjoyment i derived from all the banal dialogue and its embarrassing story ( if it wasn't a parody , then it's a horrible script , and if it is a parody , it doesn't work , the story is too ambiguous ) was the b- movie one-liners that kept coming throughout the film . since that's the only thing i liked about this film , i'll drop a few of them on you : freddy to another gangster , " never miss a good chance to shut up . " one gangster talking to another , " i was so popular in high school , everybody hated me . " i'll mention two quotes mr . petosa gives us from his vaudeville shtick he seemed to be doing for his characterization , " if money didn't grow on trees , how come banks have so many branches ? " and " chaste makes waste . " henry tritely says , " my whole life seems to be taking place without me in it . " beverly to henry , which is the most pertinent line in the film , banal as it is , " your whole life is searching for one thing , and all that other stuff just fades away . " i don't know what the story is supposed to mean ; maybe its just a search-for-identity kind of film ; maybe its an updated fairytale about " the prince and the pauper , " as one critic suggests . but i found it to be muddled , unfunny , and the acting is so lame , especially matthew modine's overacting , that it is almost unbearable to watch . but i got a kick out of those stupid one-liners from all the zanies trying so hard to be to be zany , and there was something intangible about the film that made you keep watching it , hoping there was something there that you missed seeing . so , at least , it's an original film ; a passable one , at that , with a lot of possibility to it ; and , it is done in the bizarre auteur style this filmmaker likes to operate in . 
the game is a manipulative but entertaining film that falls far short of director fincher's more successful , seven . the game takes on dangerous pretensions , as douglas wonders if this is really a game or is it to be taken for real , or is he just being scammed . we watch him begin to unravel , and you are perhaps feeling like i do at this point of the story , that i am being set-up , following a tale that is so unbelievable , that i am being taken for a sucker to buy into this . anyway , we are not that concerned about douglas , maybe that's because we don't have much to go on why he is as obnoxious and joyless as he is , except we learn that his father committed suicide when he was a child and he never quite got over it . the best feature of the film is its unpredictability , it is what sucks you into watching the entire film expecting something sensational to take place . i thought any ending would be apt . i never got a sense that what was happening mattered . and when you become conscious that what is going on is all acting and only acting , even if films are just that , nevertheless , they should hold out the illusion that what is on screen is real , and if that is not so , then it becomes natural to lose interest in the story and you become prepared to accept whatever it is that you see happening on the screen , whatever the director wants to put in , any logic will do . i felt nothing as i watched to see if douglas will commit suicide , or if this is really an on-the-level game , or if douglas will be transformed by the game into a better human being ( which to me would be the phoniest way for this film to end ) . so when i saw what actually developed , i could only think of how clever this filmmaker is , that he used the same formula that someone making toothpaste commercials might use to catch the consumer's attention . art is more metaphorical than that , commercial films are not , their bottom line is always the almighty dollar and the gimmick that will get it for them . this film should be pleasing to those who like to play games . the director is a graduate from the video and advertising world , well able to work in that slick media market , who has come up with a novel idea for a film but one that falls short in being credible . 
all she can say is , that she needs my help because she is weak . she learns that others think her do-gooder nature causes more harm to others than good , that if she can't help in a positive way she should step aside and let the other person fend for themselves ; that she does this because she is a self-indulgent person . the acting was convincing , but the story didn't have enough suspense in it to sustain interest , especially when the ending was becoming increasingly predictable , as the story wore on . what interested me in a rather oblique way , was how tired life in poland seemed , and how the real enemy seemed to be the bureaucratic nature of the country , that was off-handedly touched upon in the scenes at work , as the love triangle waned in my interest . i thought of how different things were in america during that time frame of the '70s , and how similar bureaucracies seem to be wherever they exist , whatever the time frame is . 
this film's narrative promises much to say about how violent man is , as it uses contemporary l . a . for its location . but in the end , it fails to deliver the goods ; for reasons that are not artistically clear to me , wenders decides to abruptly check out of this slow developing non-story and end it without resolving it satisfactorily . the film seemed to be oozing completely out of energy and purpose . it made me wonder why wenders seemed to be so concerned in the first place with the socio-political manifestations of a top-secret government project gone awry and the public being exploited by hollywood ; and then , he concentrated for most of the film on the usual crime stuff of murder and missing persons , basically ignoring what he tried so hard to bring to center stage . i have always found wenders to be a bit pretentious ; and , at the same time , alluring . he always seems to bait me into thinking there is something more to his films than there are . there are exceptions , like his wonderful film wings of desire , but most of the time i feel that i am being intellectually short-changed by such deceptions . this picture is a perfect example of what i mean . most interesting and diverting scenes in this part of the film concern the poetry performance readings that some of the movie folks attend . one of the readings is more powerful than anything that has to do with the story being told . is wenders being the arty wenders , creating interest by being evocative no matter what the film calls for . i am not challenging his use of such scenes , they are wonderful ; but , i am put off by his inability to keep the story from going cold . the last part of this narrative , has all these parts of the tale come together for a violent conclusion . it leaves us with the belief that the violence will not be curtailed , but will go on ; therefore , there will be no such a thing as an end to violence . thereby , the film's title is the opposite of what the film really means to say . or , is it ? wenders has succeeded in creating a mishmash of images that are incendiary , but not penetrating enough for us to believe in the characters of the story , or to follow through on what this film is supposed to be about . in fact , you might be angrier and more prone to have a violent reaction to the film , than you would be to believe that wenders has taken this film in the direction needed for us to see what is meant by an end of violence . he lost me somewhere down the line . it seems to be a film concerned about government conspiracies and missing persons , but turns out to be more concerned with societal problems , values , and alienation , and does not do any of these topics sufficient justice in covering it . this results in a film that has a few good ideas but goes astray , leaving it with a disjointed look , that is artistically satisfying to watch but empty of meaningful inquiry . 
it succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for those who like to see brad pitt' pecs and how edward norton squirms when beaten up , and be bemused to hear helena bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex . the film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the " old " noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent-- society as a whole . the sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point , too much glitter , and pitt' and norton' overacting ; what results is a jarring experience , enough to make you think without thinking that being sado-masochistic is the way to achieve respect ( it doesn't matter if this is meant to be a parody reflecting the violence in america : the violence is the thing in this story that the audience will remember most about this film ) . it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film , which makes the provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life , which are given to them by false prophets , something that is happening currently in america to a great extent . but this film is too stilted , unconvincing , and inane to be the messenger delivering a warning about such dangers in society . but if its comedy that it is after , then it has some success in meeting those expectations , as the stars were able to project themselves into this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift . the more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy , the more we learn how depraved he is . human lives are not part of this equation . a homo-erotic edge to their relationship is also hinted at , but like everything in this film , it is only superficially covered . the narrator suffers from insomnia , probably caused by his non-meaningful life . the utterly depraved tyler , exhibiting the ability to be a leader , with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims against the emptiness of materialism , such as , " you are not your job , " and the irresolute narrator , who is someone crying out for help and who is also someone ripe for being brainwashed . that all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of taste , though i think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way , where bad taste rules the day . the humor is catered to those who like their laughs coming to them shock treatment style . their alienation from society , supposedly , relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems , which should give the film a conventional reason for being made . the problem with the film's message , is that it comes via a film that is relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story , and then , to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason , is almost enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent shootings in america's schools and the other sensational newsworthy violent acts , wonder what to make of this film , or to just barf at this outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in such a mindlessly simple way . the fatuous simplicity the film offers for linking america's penchant for violence and sex , with the peoples' lack of fulfillment from meaningful jobs , is too much of a generality to be taken seriously . this response to what has gone wrong with the american dream is just as banal and wrong-headed a response , as those who would blame films such as this one for america's problems . at some point in the film , probably as soon as the fight club was started by tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret society of mayhem , the film stopped being smart and turned into a pointless nonsensical venture , that is not serious enough to take seriously , except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual style and kinetic energy it shows . the film's undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by tyler , that " it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything , " is an alluring one . if that were developed further along in the storyline , then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say , such as the drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the shackles of a consumer society . i didn't fall under brad pitt' spell as easily as edward norton and helena bonham carter did , and therefore was not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved . for me , this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks it's in the heavyweight class . what it offers for philosophy , is similar to the kind of superficial sound bites the tv news might offer to comment on its headline stories , as the news people seem to always play it safe and never take a radical position on the events they cover . what the film offers as philosophy is pseudo-philosophy , for a story that is more steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications in a consumer society . it is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies , and the emptiness of their materialistic lives . exploring that avenue , and not getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film , might have been a more radical route to have gone down . it was very hard for me to see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it , but was disappointing in its scope . . . and . . . was certainly not a radical film . 
as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this , it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls , and it does so , by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it . to a lesser degree , this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat , as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts . the film's title , living out loud , is deliberately misleading , as it should really be retitled as " fantasizing out loud . " this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with self-awareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film . its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the film's stars . i didn't , so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative , to the bargain . my problem is that i didn't really care what happened to them . why they were sad and lonely , is a sympathetic enough story , but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go . the only innovative feature of the film , which did save it from the doldrums , was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work . the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov , which works out reasonably well on film , though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books . at least the film never turns to mush , as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes , such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice ( trust me , it wasn't on a par to the biblical solomon's advice ) . but i couldn't picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute , these two were just not compatable . but come to think of it , she's pretty dull herself . the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur ( cibrian ) , who gives her the sex massage she dreams of , are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought , but this is certainly not a way to self-discovery and a way out of her situation , though it seems to help her in someway , but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped . this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste ; but , it is , nevertheless , faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation , and what the heck , they seem to be ok people , and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight . his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film , has worked with mixed results . i think the major fault for the film's dullness lies with the co-stars ; i couldn't get aroused by holly hunter's performance , as intelligent as it was , it was still too plain and too staid . while danny de vito , who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a second-banana , wasn't funny enough here and couldn't be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly . i'm not saying that he was completely miscast , he did bring some depth to his character's anguished situation and believability to his role . but someone else , a more romantic leading man , might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed . though i realize the point of the story was that these two weren't really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their non-romance . but my point is , that they could have been not suited for each other all right , but not by such a wide margin as these two were . but that was also too predictable an ending , limiting the scope of the film . 
this b-movie , made in b/w , is a cheapie from american-international pictures , and is good for a few laughs and a few shakes of the head . when he tries to read the bible it has shrunk so much , that the print is too small for him to read . it is also a trip to watch this bald headed giant eat like a giant does and to see how he simply dwarfs all those who visit him . the special effects were fine , the quasi documentary atmosphere it presented helped give it the look of a cold war era film ; the movie was seriously done but nevertheless it was hilarious . what the film failed to do , was be anything but cynical . for all its failings and ridiculous dialogue i , nevertheless , enjoyed watching this 80 minutes of hokum . mercifully , the film wasn't any longer . 
benedict heinrich , head of a fascist government ) - are in a horror film that shows little affinity for the genre and apart from a few scares , this is a rather tepid effort put forth by the director . scream and scream again was based on peter saxon's novel 'the disoriented man , ' but it is the story that seems out of whack rather than the title . these are the quirky characteristics found throughout the film that makes its humor rather odd and might appeal to certain fans of this genre . the result is a race of emotionless and mindless androids . the film ends with a cryptic warning by fremont that all is not over with yet . this muddled story is not supposed to make sense and it doesn't , it is supposed to shock your senses and if you were thusly shocked , i suppose you got your money's worth out of this b- film . there is no real character study accomplished . the dialogue ranged from being trite to being ludicrous . overall , this was a weakly crafted film that probably has brought to the surface enough undeveloped ideas in it , to make it a somewhat bearable film to view during parts of it and a film that fans of the three horror stars should want to see , if for no other reason but for that alone . 
it also puts him in a depressed mood , as he says he would rather die than live and not play his music . the remainder of the film flounders in long stretches of unbelievable fantasy , some soothing touches of originality here and there , oodles of romantic schmaltz , and a story that can't hold up to intelligent scrutiny . but , then again , if you bought into the film's gimmicky filmmaking style and didn't think it was a smarty-arty pretentious ploy like i did , then maybe you can have a better feel for how the story transpired than i did . pabst's silent masterpiece . catherine gets a chance at the dinner table to tell izzy , that she gave up acting because i didn't want to be invented by anyone , anymore . but the funniest conversation at the dinner table is reserved for one between izzy and phil , as phil wants izzy's opinion on what he would do if he found a piece of turd on an airplane toilet seat cover after an attractive lady left the toilet , like he did on a recent flight . you see , it was a contrivance for the script . the filmmaker must have thought it would work out better for the story if he gets jumped in nyc rather than in dublin . all we get to know about the mystery of the stone is from dr . van horn , as we hear him prattle on about how precious the stone is , and if in the right hands , such as his , how much good it can do . there will be no payoff regarding knowing about this mystery , which is a major problem with the film . there is so much wrong with this film , that even when things are going well for it and it seems like there's some suspense and an intriguing bit of artiness thrown into the script , inevitably it is ruined by a story that just doesn't make sense , and even if it did make sense to those who are more tolerant of the film than i was , it still doesn't excuse the filmmaker from trying to be too clever and disguising his story as something it isn't . to be more precise in my critique , would be to give away the film's flimsy payoff , which would not be fair to those who haven't seen lulu yet . i just got the feeling auster didn't know too much more about this mystery than the viewer did , and because of that the film is lacking substance . i also thought keitel was too old to play the love interest of a much younger sorvino , as their romance , the keystone of the film , failed to be inspiring , as it should have been for the film to have had any chance to be effective . 
i think the writers got their facts mixed up about the affects of the poisonous weed , as i believe it acts as an hallucinogenic or as a poison that can kill you , but it doesn't necessarily cause drowsiness and especially not when put into caffeine . the story was trying desperately to say that inter-racial love was okay , and by having the heroic figures of the story be half-breeds , this 1956 film is going as far as it wants to go with that tolerant attitude . it is just too bad that tab is such a vanilla actor and natalie is earnest but unconvincing in her role as a half-breed . their romance has no fire in it , it was almost like it was a pedantic exercise in virtue that we were witnessing . with more suitable actors in the starring roles , this could have been a much more relevant film . the only actor with some life to him was skip homeier , but he was too much of a caricature of evil for his character to be anything but cardboard-like manic . what was out place about this film , was that despite the beautiful photography and gripping action scenes , the story covered no new ground , though it had its opportunities , but it failed to take advantage of them . what remains solid about the film , is that if you get off on watching a western with a revenge motive , then this one never strays from that motive . 
a hurricane warning is issued , but because of the poor radio equipment they have , which was not properly repaired by willy , the message is cut off and they don't know how serious that storm will be . but willy's most fatal mistake was to purchase fire extinguishers that were cheap , but would comply in appearance with the air safety codes . it was purchased at the price this airline run on a shoestring could afford , the only trouble was that they were the wrong type of extinguishers for an airplane , and if used , they can cause deadly fumes to be released rather than extinguish the fire . this scares the living daylights out of the prevaricator . her role in the film is never developed , as it is based on a generalization of what someone like her should be like . this kiss is seen by the dismayed pilot . the film's ending is routine formula fare , with a few " predictable " surprises of heroism and villainy , the kind of middling story churned out regularly by the studios who lack the imagination to delve into anything but superficial waters . so what you have is familiary known as a typical disaster b- movie , a precursor to all those other movies of this genre that were very popular with audiences from the late '70s- on . the film fits into the formula mold that studios use over and over again , with the obligatory tense action scenes and the typical danger scenes that call for a hero to be manufactured . you know what i mean , everyone who watches films over the years will run across one like this one , which , by the way , wasn't too bad of a film to watch . the actors had enough vigor in them to keep it going , and the story seemed to move along at a brisk and mindless pace . 
a 'b' movie political thriller , that was shrewd enough to get newsreel footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of parliament into its closing action scenes . the weak script and uninspiring dialogue , is compensated for by the crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story . the revengeful hennessy has a one-track mind , never revealing anything about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with such a ludicrous scheme , as the one he has hatched . this is one of those films that doesn't add up if you think about it . the film hopes to get by because of the taut acting jobs of its lead characters and by the semi-documentary glossy black-and-white look its color tinted film has , giving it a natural and gritty feel . but the film's ending has so many holes in its planning , that the film seems incredulous and the points it make seem dull , and its suspense is not that nerve wracking either , since you can almost bet your house that the filmmakers are not going to have the loony hennessy blow up parliament . the best things one can say about the film , was that the acting wasn't bad and it was watchable even if it was not a very believable story . 
the film should be like a meditation , as the introspective primo wants to get it out of his system what it meant to be a jewish prisoner and how it was unbearable to come out of that camp and think that you could still be human . turturro plays the tragic role with an understandable quietude ( his voice barely rises above a whisper ) and with an emotional understatement , conveying a deep sadness in his gestures and deep reflections , showing how difficult it is for him to see the light of day again without feeling atrophied and lost . he is the reason for any success the film has . unfortunately , the rest of the film , as worthy an effort as it is , about a subject matter that merits to be told again and again , as its holocaust tale can't be told enough to the world for its message to sink in and should be told in a multitude of ways ; nevertheless , as compelling as the film was at times , it also shot itself in the foot by trying to tell a conventional story while the more powerful and personal tale of primo levi was somewhat sacrificed by these very typical hollywood episodic scenes of how the other characters reacted to their liberation and with rosi's added attempt to attain some comic relief from these diverse characters being poorly accomplished . the meditations of primo levi and soberness of the story were the thing to shoot for here , and all one has to do is read primo's book and see how much more gripping those images were there when read than the screen images that tended to be tedious and somewhat diverting after awhile . 'the greek' somehow is running a bordello there . cesare keeps reminding primo , don't be so glum , it is laughter that is the cure all for this misery we have undergone . for primo levi , " god cannot exist if auschwitz exists . " as for the film's title , rosi explained , " life is a truce between the moment we're born and the moment we die . " i just couldn't help feeling that this earnest attempt at capturing the mood of that horrific event , lacked whatever it takes to make this a first-rate film . 
douglas fairbanks plays his first action hero role as zorro , the sort of part he will play for the rest of his film career , before this very popular film he was cast only in light comedies . he is dressed in a black mask-and- cape , which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences . the film is not much on character study , instead it's filled with action sequences and a melodramatic love story between zorro , who hides his true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher don alejandro ( de gray ) , and the sweet lolita pukido ( marguerite ) . there is no mistake about who the goodguys and who the badguys are in this childlike adventure story . it reminded me of a charlie chaplin routine , the one where he's the tramp and is kicking the cop in his behind . the film disappointed me in many ways , not the least being , that his plan to help the poor , seemed misplaced , and that this was more a story of aristocrats and those of wealth versus bad politicians rather than the robin hood story it projected itself to be . it was really a stretch to believe that the noble zorro was anything but a rich aristocrat having a bit of sport , and finding love with someone he could have easily found love with anyway without going through his masquerade . the story itself was a cliche , featuring his cardboard-typed father wanting his son not to be an idler and make something of himself , while the son feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate , performing silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible senorita his father fixed him up with . it was the type of part you can almost expect to see in a film like this , and one that is void of any real human emotions . there are no surprises in this predictable costume actioner , but it is pleasantly shot in b&w with a tinted look to it . it should please those who like their films to be lighthearted . because it was such a successful film box-office wise and was a precursor to the type of film hollywood is noted for putting forth , it could be interesting just to see how this silent yarn compares with the viewer's take on the more modern action films . 
a b- film psychological thriller from the 1942 novel by stefan zweig that runs out of thrills eventually and ends on a flat note ; but , for a while , it had its exhilarating moments of suspense . the acting by everyone but jurgens was horrid . the story made no great impression on me but it was curious to watch how someone can handle isolation by concentrating on the intricacies of a game he doesn't really understand . overall , the film was just passable entertainment , nothing more . 
this seemingly laconic b&w pseudodocumentary-styled noir film , with a patriotic message supporting the u . s . war effort in korea and offering a scathing commentary on counterfeiters , comparing them to saboteurs , as the film states the most powerful weapon in america's arsenal against communism- is money , turns out to be basically a promotional movie for the work that the treasury department agents do . in this film , he never brings about any tension or real shock to the story , as he did in his first noir work . the movie reminds me of the 1950s tv series , dragnet . it is played in the same sobering tone , with no room for comedy or any quirkiness to the vanilla story unfolding . in the end , it is a certainty that everything will be wrapped up in a tidy manner . the film was based on a true story , and seems as if it were a documentary . 
the film seems like a museum piece , about a time that existed long ago but strangely enough , probably , still exists . the story is told in a dry , matter-of-fact style , with the b&w photography adding a gritty feel to the secretive work environment and the snow-capped streets of ottawa . this picture had the look of something that was important , but it didn't have more to say than what any reasonable person could already assume about the soviet union . 
for a film that runs close to 70- minutes , is in b&w , and is short on storyline , this b-film does a nice job in getting a hugh cast to be part of this crime caper , each getting into the act with a brief moment of quality movie time . the falcon's brother is a routine espionage story , that is crisply told in a manner that is formularised and executed to perfection . everything in this film goes as expected , the cops are gently razzed , the villains are easy to detect , the romance is easy to handle , the story is easy on the noggin , and if you are not looking for anything fancy here , you'll extract your ounce of entertainment value from it . if you've seen one falcon episode , then you might as well have said you've seen them all . this one would rate as an average one . reason they were so popular , is because they're so easy to watch and the stars exude a certain amount of charm , making these little crime capers quite enjoyable . 
bosnian-born writer/director emir kusturica ( time of the gypsies , underground ) has come up with a robust ( lively music and characters with plenty of energy ) but excessive screwball comedy with felliniesque touches here and there , and before the film literally goes in the shit , it was able to show some warm romantic moments and garner many laughs from its odd-looking and strangely-acting characters . grga pitic ( sabri sulejman ) is the old-wily patriarch enamored with the ending to the " casablanca " film , which he often watches on his video ( it could be said , that one of the film's themes could be about a beautiful friendship formed by a seemingly odd pair ) . the film comes replete with a happy ending , as noted onscreen by the ending saying just that . the two cats appear as the title and are seen constantly crawling in and out of scenes , sometimes contributing in a comical way to what is happening onscreen . the film is sometimes a " keystone kops " comedy , like those old mack sennett films . the film just ran too long , close to two hours , for a story that shouldn't have been longer than 90- minutes . the group of gypsies were mostly nonprofessional actors , colorful characters , with their mouths filled with gold teeth , and a screen presence that was absurd and defying in logic . this original film offered something different to see , for a viewer who usually doesn't get to see real gypsies onscreen . it's a noisy comedy , with a loud brass band coming in at any time during the film . it takes suspension of belief on the part of the viewer to stick with this one for its complete romp across gypsy land , plus the skits become too labored to sustain the frenetic pace of the film . the characters make this film enjoyable . the gypsies are real humdingers ; they are always grinning ; and , while acting grotesque , they seem to be cruel , and ridiculous . the warm moment in the film , is the romance between branka and florijan , vanishing in a field of sunflowers . she's a live-wire , and when onscreen was a commanding presence . 
a fairly-routine ww11 action-packed film . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it avoids a lot of the usual cornball war film clich ? s about the brotherhood between the troops . its rise in critical evaluation over the years , where it was once reviewed as a typical war movie but now because of siegal's rising star as a director , has been granted " cult status , " which resulted in receiving much higher praise than i think it deserves . what siegel did for this b&w film , along with ww11 expert robert pirosh , was tighten up the script , make it more suspenseful , and emphasized the psychological differences between the few men of the 2nd squad and the pyschopathological attitude of the mcqueen character . the film opens in montigny , france-1944 . after the men spot this , newhart goes into a telephone routine he used as a stand-up comedian , but only here it is not funny and seems out of place . this is a film that builds to a climax for its brutal payoff . the men seem to think that this makes sense . he won't do anything until he clears it with pike . pike in a friendly gesture asks reese : " were you right ? " reese responds : " how the hell do i know . " >from the film's title , you can determine how the film will end , as the men prepare to attack the german pillbox , strengthened by company reinforcements . the film can make claim to its antiwar sentiments by showing the insanity of the attack . for me it was just another war film , nothing special . 
there's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir film , one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a smallpox outbreak in the new york city of 1947 . it is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of america's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything foreign , as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken by something unknown attacking it . to make sure that you know that he is the heavy in the story , he will speak with a foreign accent . everything foreign in this film is either connected with something sick or with something dangerous to america . the action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told , while the noir characterizations of sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject , but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it . the mechanical acting by everyone , except for keyes , and the unconvincing action scenes made the film appear as the b film it was , despite the great noir camerawork of joseph biroc , who caught how dark the city could be for someone on-the-run . 
this is a remake of clouzot's very memorable le corbeau . though not a complete failure , preminger's american version still managed to take most of the starch out of this bitter french chiller and make it seem dull and predictable . even i guessed who was writing the poison letters , and i'm not especially good at that sort of movie detective work . the film changes scenery from its original version in france and now takes place in a small-town near quebec , canada . the film opens by painting onscreen hollywood's idea of what a small-town looks and feels like , as the sun is shining , the mailman is cheerful and nosy , and everything about the town looks picture-perfect . pearson says it's nonsense . but laurent takes a more cautionary approach saying , " you can't dismiss these letters completely , they are written by a psychopath , and they have been known to act against their own interest . " spoiler : if you don't want to know who the poison letter writer is , skip the remainder of the review . the film lost its power and energy to be viewed as a true noir film , and ends up being more like a flat- 'who done it thriller . ' the force of its noir story never fully materialized under preminger's hollywood type of direction . the psychological motives of the couple were too murky to have much intellectual impact on the story . 
this tolerable but not particularly interesting noir film suffers from a meaningless story , lacklustre direction , and even though , it has a good cast , the two glamorous stars , robert taylor and ava gardner , seem miscast : they are too beautiful for their parts . there was no conviction felt in the two stars succumbing to their pangs of love ; they brought little to the story in the way of true cynical noir feeling , and it is only the heavies , vincent price and charles laughton , who keep the film hopping with their stock villainous portrayals . the film , badly compromised by the romantic directions it headed in , was unable to pick up steam , until the finale , where there is a splendid shootout between taylor and price amidst a fireworks display . but by that time , the story seemed too trite to really matter , and its main theme about the moral dilemma of whether taylor should accept a lot of cash to look the other way or of letting ava go even if she was guilty , because taylor fell in love with her , seemed to hardly matter . he was the only one in the film who was even remotely interesting and who , along with price , seemed to be in the right film . " the bribe " was shot in the mgm studio and has a phony look to it and enough trite dialogue in it to put a few yawns on your kisser . say it often enough and its just a sound without any meaning , anymore . " that could also describe this film , as it lost its purpose early on and never found any true meaning in its story . 
" open your eyes " asks a lot of questions , such as : how do you know if you are awake or dreaming ? how do you know if you are sane or mad ? how do you know what is real or fantasy ? how do you know if you killed someone or not ? this stylish work , filmed in all the sleekness of a modern madrid inhabited by the affluent young , tells its jarring tale in a non-linear way , sure to confuse even the most avid moviegoer . he has the smile of a professional charmer and the warmth of a snake . if you like playing guessing games and are taken with the slickness of this bold but not exactly fresh script ( i've seen mind-games like this played-out in some recent films , including " the game " ) , then you will have a more favorable impression of the film than i did . i felt it tried to be interesting , and touched on many different genres , from romance to sci-fi , to tell its kafkaesque denouement , but it was not particularly a moving experience . i felt uninvolved , finding myself easily drifting into my own dreamworld , and as diverting , beautifully acted and photographed , and entertaining as the film was , i thought it was mostly about style and not ideas . 
catherine keener , a normally interesting actress , has nothing to do in this role but whine and act drab . cage , at all times seems wooden , never relaxed in the role . it makes one nervous just watching him trying to act a role he can't seem to get the handle on . it just never came off that way , and for a number of reasons , not the least of them being , was that cage wasn't right for the part and that he was never seen in a reflective moment undergoing a life change . the dramatics here seemed misplaced , as if they were intended more for one of the director's batman flicks , something the director brought more life to than he did with this film . but this time the look seems artificial and not well-placed , as cage is not really an introspective person , he is just someone trying to make a better life for himself at a job he is good at . and that is the main problem with the film , it has a false gritty noir look to it . this film is not the real deal , it's ersatz . therefore it never works on the intellect , instead it attacks the emotions and cheapens its efforts by pretending to delve into cage's angst . even the credible camera work , which seems too sharp-edged for the film , works against it , because it is so much better than the story and the weak acting , that it highlights even more , how artificial the film seems . the heavies of the film are all personifications of pure evil . there is nothing good about them . poole is the contact and distributor of the film . velvet is the tacky artist ; he makes the films . velvet is considered to be the jim jarmusch of s&m films . the results are as gratituous as any found in a myriad of cheap adventure films that appeal to a ready made audience , not looking for a thinking picture . the box office mistake of this film , is that it took itself seriously , somehow believing itself a thinking picture , and thereby lost both types of audiences . because those who enjoy the exploitive gore films , must have found something lacking here also , like just enough thinking to turn them off from the film . the film had perhaps one line in it that didn't seem phony , when the masked killer is unmasked and says , " the things i do--i do them because i like them . because i want to . i wasn't abused as a child . i don't hate my parents . '' it is everywhere . that dilemma might have worked as a morality play , if the acting and the story didn't seem so wooden and phony . 
a sophisticated mid-victorian drama , told in the form of an allegory , about upper class society , playing more like a pbs special or a high-brow merchant-ivory film but with a darker secret to tell . it comments on the environment influencing one's behavior more than anything else , as the female protagonist is studying a colony of red ants attacking black ones . she is like the butterfly , so delicate and beautiful to behold . which refers to the servants , but might be the closest we come to anything resembling angels in this film . she chastises him one day by saying to him , " you do not know if i am aged 30 or 50'' . if one can read his mind , he is saying to himself i shouldn't have married for looks . he also has a few children , whom he does not feel strongly about . the film was visually pleasing ; the costumes were beautiful ; the script was acceptably literate , and the film ably took the viewer into an antiquated world and its peculiar customs , where the many maids who worked at the estate turned their back to the wall in the presence of their betters , giving one some rough idea about life there . the problem with the film , was that it was tedious and had no emotional oomph to it . the acting was stiff . the pace of the film was lethargic . the most interesting sights were the insects themselves , which if that's your thing , it would be better to view on one of those nature shows public television has . overall , this film showed the dramatic events in too clinical a manner for it to be viewed as anything more than a competent production . 
there will be no happy hollywood type of ending here . the film was mildly diverting , suffering from a weak storyline and trevor howard as the lead actor . he is too regal an actor to play a noir protagonist . what was gritty about the film , was the quick-cut editing , the magnificent black and white photography , and the keen direction . the film had a certain amount of distress coming forth from it characters and lots of brutal scenes , adding much suspense to the routine story . but the british films are no match to the americans when it comes to noir , this one being no exception . 
what can i say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots , was driven by a fantastic performance by bruce willis as a contract killer , but was disturbingly vulgar ( the murder of an undercover cop is used as part of the comedy routine ) , except to say that it was driven by characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other . it was also a more palatable of a film than i thought it would be . these demented zany characters , not one of them who was without a blemished soul ( reminiscent of pulp fiction and analyze this ) , is a popular reworking of the gangster film into comedy , a phenomena of recent times worth taking note of in the gangster genre . the result is a film that gets over , more or less , as a parody . a film that is farcical and loopy , but leaves a lot to be desired . it still looks likes like a sitcom to me . the plot starts off simple and then becomes more complicated as more characters are introduced . she is disappointed that the likable oz can't make a good living out of his practice . he tells him he works for janni and after punching the dentist around offering some more excuses for sight gags and pratfalls , he brings him to see janni . the conversation from the heavily accented janni goes something like this , " i yust hate yimmy . the british born director jonathan lynn ( my cousin vinny ) , after a so-far mediocre career , has become more skilled at pacing a film , as the non-stop action scenes make the film fly by quickly , which might actually be its best asset . this is lighweight entertainment and should work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script , questionable values , and that there are no nice people in the film . but . . . the film is funny . 
if there is one word that describes this conspiracy thriller , a take-off on the oklahoma city federal building bombing , that word is preposterous . this is a sloppily made film , imitative of the smoother made " the parallax view . " it lures you into thinking it has someplace to go , but after one coincidence too many and details that don't rationally add up , this film begins to soon feel like it has been weighed down with lead . there was never for one moment , after faraday looks at the plans of a mall project at lang's house and says that's not the mall , it's an office building , did i think that this was going to be a serious story . and that is one of the major problems with the film , it pretended to be serious yet it couldn't hold its end in the bargain and provide a story that made sense . it was a loopy story , with a somewhat promising beginning but a terrible ending . the lang's seem like a benign , suburban couple , easily smiling and engaging in small talk . tim robbins and joan cusack play the smiling but sinister couple until it becomes nerve-wracking to watch them try and pull this nonsense pose off , any further . the payoff comes in the film's last fifteen minutes , and it seems so artificial . the film is resolved in an incredulous fashion , as if it were trying to evoke a cry of sympathy ( ala oklahoma city ) for a tragedy that seemed acted out for symbolic purposes rather than portraying real people made up of flesh and blood . there is no possible way that scenario could work except in a move like this one . if you leave aside the unconvincing acting , the implausible story , its inane political views , then you might find this film somewhat entertaining and it may raise for you some pertinent questions about the fbi's handling of recent bombings . i just felt annoyed that the script tried to be too cute and i never warmed up to the way the film was indelicately handled . 
brian de palma's idea of a thriller is short-changed as far as plot and substance in favor of style . he has created a silly but entertaining film , where one shocking scene tops another , and numerous hollywood cheesy gimmicks are used instead of relying on john farris' tightly drawn suspense story . tis a pity such crass commercialization should rule the day for de palma , instead of artistic integrity ! this follow-up to his commercially successful carrie , takes the director further into the ridiculous realm of demonic possessions and all that would imply to a hollywood director who is looking to make a popcorn movie . any hope for this being a plot oriented film soon goes down the drain and the movie turns into a horror film , with special effects galore , rolling demonic flashing eyes , and shocking scenes with blood and gore . how wonderful ! cassavetes is a great villain . but there's really not much in this film that is plausible , except a chance to escape from the world for two hours . 
it questions the military leader's decision not to even fire a shot , though outmanned and sure to be defeated , but offering no resistance or support to their countrymen . that seemed hard to believe , considering they had an armed force of some three thousand . the result is a straightforward , old-fashioned drama that shows his mettle and crustiness , in a film noted solely for his sterling performance . the film ably depicts the peaceful nature of the norwegian people and how they found war to be a very difficult position for them to be in , and how confused everyone was at the time , as there was a lack of leadership from the top . there is mass confusion and no strong leadership present there . but that doesn't stop the men from laughing at thor , who is dressed in his outdated uniform and is so much older than anyone else at headquarters . the last lieutenant doesn't have anything new to say , but what it says about one's loyalty to country and how its military leaders were faced with difficult decisions , was deftly handled by first-time director hans petter moland . it is a film for those who want to see a different approach to war films , one where the study of character is more important than the battle scenes and the arguments of ideology . the film told a decent story . it's only problem was , that it just wasn't that exciting a picture . 
it takes too much of a suspension of reality to believe in this outlandish plot : the devil is in our heads and was placed there by ordinary contact with others ( it spreads like germs do ) , even though it is played with zeal and candor by denzel washington , who is the squeaky-clean super detective john hobbes . the film is basically a horror film teaser , trying to say something about azazel that it really can't say without sounding ridiculous . there is also heavy use of fuzzy camera images by the cinematographer to indicate that the devil was being photographed from his point of view . these shots of the devil's viewpoint were overworked into the script to the point of overkill . the film worked only on a superficial level , as light entertainment and should be given credit for , at least , attempting to have a literate script . it is basically an escapist film , that failed to build-up tension as the story went on . indeed , by the film's last scene , the story waned in interest , proving mosly that time wasn't on its side . thusly , we have all been duly prepped for the supernatural part of the story to follow . these scenes have a good feel to them as they are grounded in reality and capture the feel of the detective world hobbes inhabits . ms . milano , who conveniently happens to be a professor of theology , tells hobbes , " if you value your life , if there's even one human being you care about , walk away from this case . " by this time , the story lost its base of reality . the evil spirit that couldn't die moves from person to person , and there is a chase scene in a crowd where the possessed pursuer could be anyone , which was exciting to watch , but added little to the meaning of the story . denzel's noir-like voiceover seemed artificial , an imitation of how a real noir film operates . he was also not convincing as a noir protagonist , he seemed more like a cop who was in a horror movie but might have been better off being in a straight movie about a cop being framed by corrupt cops . the premise of the occult tale was too silly to take seriously . but the film plodded on , getting more ridiculous by the minute , until it ended on a note of surprise , in the twisted manner one expected a film like this to end on . 
the film is done almost documentary-like , and it almost seems believable , as the actors are all straightfaced about what is happening . i've seen a lot of sci-fi films that didn't make as much sense as this one does . that doesn't mean that i think this b-film made too much sense . but it was bearable and it didn't try to sensationalize the monster's killing spree , and if you are not too fussy about the flat dialogue and the phony mexican accents heard , one might even find this film to be easy to take on a rainy saturday afternoon . 
it gives the believers in such spiritual transcendence something to cheer about and may give the faithful christians who view the film , a renewed belief in heaven and hell , in god , and in redemption , through the means of a feel-good story , such as this one , that is steeped in religious allegory . the green mile is the most faithful retelling of a stephen king novel ever put to film , and thereby someone like myself who is not a fan of his , is stuck with the popular writer's excesses on film ( he makes me cringe at how scattered his artistic intentions usually turn out to be ) . the message of this film is so muddled and unclear , that there seems to be no point to be made , except how nice most of the people are in this prison . it is a film exploitively showing miracles that an audience might enjoy seeing on the screen , while others might be taken in by the benign mood of the story , others could be enthralled by seeing how the electric chair works , and still others might just like the film for its solid development of its main characters . there was much to like about this implausible thriller , that would have been better served , if it had only been pared down to around an eighty or ninety minute film . darabont spends so much time with a mouse called mr . jingles , who serves no essential need in the story , whose animated antics for the most part bored me . the best thing about the film was its performances , from hank's nice guy guard to duncan's enormous presence to david morse's role as the steady death row prison guard . the actors were all terrific , they couldn't have handled themselves any better , especially since they were dealing with material that was very hard to swallow . the star of the film , though , is an electric chair fondly called " old sparky " by the guards . the filmmaker laboriously goes through the electric chair drill that the guards have before the execution , which made for at least a dull half hour of viewing . but not satisfied with that , the audience is treated to three other electric chair executions and watching all the dull routines the guards go through in their daily work schedule . paul says of him , " the man is mean , careless and stupid--that's a bad combination in a place like this . " you can just guess what happens to these two sadistic jerks by the film's end , sort of king's reward to the audience for sitting through all his spooky doings , as he throws them a bone for their patience and lets them see what they wanted to see happen to those two . the green mile is a handsomely made film , one that tried so hard to make the audience forget how emotionally manipulative it was . he is viewed as someone who has been granted a divine gift , but is still afraid of the dark , is illiterate and defers to whites as expected , reinforcing the vile stereotypes for the negro of that era . with that being said , this film can't even make a concise statement about an innocent man being executed , which was the fodder of so many 1930s prison films , whose directors clearly took a stand . if the filmmaker wanted to make a statement against such executions , the everyman tom hanks plays , wouldn't have been the one pulling the switch in my film . i would have chosen an actor with a darker personality to play the part . it gives the believers in such spiritual transcendence something to cheer about and may give the faithful christians who view the film , a renewed belief in heaven and hell , in god , and in redemption , through the means of a feel-good story , such as this one , that is steeped in religious allegory . the green mile is the most faithful retelling of a stephen king novel ever put to film , and thereby someone like myself who is not a fan of his , is stuck with the popular writer's excesses on film ( he makes me cringe at how scattered his artistic intentions usually turn out to be ) . the message of this film is so muddled and unclear , that there seems to be no point to be made , except how nice most of the people are in this prison . it is a film exploitively showing miracles that an audience might enjoy seeing on the screen , while others might be taken in by the benign mood of the story , others could be enthralled by seeing how the electric chair works , and still others might just like the film for its solid development of its main characters . there was much to like about this implausible thriller , that would have been better served , if it had only been pared down to around an eighty or ninety minute film . darabont spends so much time with a mouse called mr . jingles , who serves no essential need in the story , whose animated antics for the most part bored me . the best thing about the film was its performances , from hank's nice guy guard to duncan's enormous presence to david morse's role as the steady death row prison guard . the actors were all terrific , they couldn't have handled themselves any better , especially since they were dealing with material that was very hard to swallow . the star of the film , though , is an electric chair fondly called " old sparky " by the guards . the filmmaker laboriously goes through the electric chair drill that the guards have before the execution , which made for at least a dull half hour of viewing . but not satisfied with that , the audience is treated to three other electric chair executions and watching all the dull routines the guards go through in their daily work schedule . paul says of him , " the man is mean , careless and stupid--that's a bad combination in a place like this .

the film's leaden pace and pancake look and wooden acting , are all major detractions . at least , he was lively and looked as if he was into the part . i'm not a believer in miracles , nor am i disbeliever in miracles . i just don't think an orthodox religion , one that demands blind faith and obedience from its members can find the truth about such spiritual matters ( that's why i'm a non-believer in orthodox religions ) . for me , a miracle is when someone overcomes their karma and finds enlightenment , and is able to be filled with love , living without illusions , who can convey this feeling to others and make the world a little better place to live in . the only proof needed for such a miracle is in the freedom felt from within , by the person experiencing it . but for those who are believers in the orthodox , needing some proof that god can hear their prays , then this serious-minded film with its lack of kitsch , supposedly , can shed some light how a saint is chosen and how miracles are documented by the church . but , unfortunately , the story is not able to overcome the handicaps of its plodding story and therefore it fails to materialize as a credible one . in my opinion , the process of choosing a saint is just as much political as religious , and the director waffled in which direction to go . in the end , she chose to cop-out , with one of those slick , unsatisfactory modern endings , which is contrary to the underpinnings of this very european-styled film . it results in a draw between the rivals within the church structure , and who feels satisified walking away from an event and not having a winner ! there is no rational explanation for this occurrence . this will be submitted to the church's upper echelons . the priest discovers he has a carnal interest in roxanna , which he is able to resolve , but it is done in such a banal way , with no chemistry between the two to justify their relationship , or does their relationship result in finding anything significant to say about a priest thinking like a man . is this too a miracle ? it was difficult to believe in the story or be absorbed in it , as the acting was stilted and the process of choosing a saint did not enlighten me as to what really happens in the church back rooms . i found it impossible to believe anything father frank found about helen would , necessarily , make her a saint , except for political reasons to satisfy the faithful . i don't know what i learned from this film , or what the film tried to deliver as a message . but i do know that the story failed to keep me from yawning , as i preferred the much more flawed recent miracle film , stigmata , to this one , even though this film had no kitsch like the other one did , but it also had very little movement and took few risks in the sober-minded way its story was told . so much for the intelligent telling of a story , if the story is not convincing . there would have to be a fourth miracle to get me to believe in this flick . 
an old-fashioned ww11 submarine movie made for men , featuring an all-male cast , played with a square jawed military call for patriotism . there are no jokes here , even though it could have used some to lighten its torpedo load . every move made in this film is seemingly life threatening , whether on a personal basis or because of the action scenes . but , aside from being as sober-minded as some of the classical films of this genre-- such as run silent , run deep , this is no wolfgang petersen's das boot ( 81 ) , the only excellent submarine film ever made thus far , but it is as thrilling and as contrived as the recent , big-budgeted crimson tide . this makes for a fairly entertaining but vacuous film , whose entertainment value , i estimate , to be in the middle-range of this genre . if you get your sea legs under you and don't mind the film's history being blurred and its insistence on making heroes out of the men at all costs , then you should find it viscerally challenging and not be underwhelmed by its clich ? s and its technical inaccuracies , as noted by other observers with far greater submarine technical knowledge than i have , who point out for example : you can't start a diesel engine in a submerged submarine . the stern-looking andy , contrary to his appearance and tight-lipped nature , is just too friendly with the crew and even though he's very competent and ambitious , he is told that his time hasn't come yet . predictably , you can figure out where the film is going with this subplot ! this matter is detailed in robert harris' novel enigma . the action is tense but hard to see what's clearly taking place , as death is happening quickly and each side looks like the other in the dark . the film has almost every expected submarine battle scene ever presented take place . it is directed with emphasis on sustaining suspense , building on the action scenes , and letting go full force with its special effects , making for a solid and exciting effort . though , to its down side , character development is the first casuality in this war film- it simply is not a top priority of the director for this nut-and- bolts actioner . the same could be said for dialogue , which consists mainly of drab submarine lingo . but i don't think this film has that something special that sometimes makes these easy-to-watch films into blockbusters . but it should do a brisk business in the box office , anyway . it is a film geared for the unthinking man that is well-crafted and impressive in carrying out its purpose to be about those who are efficient at doing their job and don't question orders . it's a change of pace from a lot of the current war films and a throwback to those old ww11 genre films , with perhaps , a new audience ready to take that leap back in time , and maybe , even an old audience , coming back to see a war that counted for something , at a time when values were much different , a time when such a full-scale war can be remembered fondly by an older generation , who know the price that was paid for the war effort by the loss of lives it cost . 
a " b " movie , based on a british tv serial called the trollenberg terror , that is not to be taken seriously while it provides enough unintentional funny material and hokem to possibly get a mute to laugh aloud . there are no pretenses , this is one of those bad movies that is enjoyable in a non-intellectual way . it features dialogue that is so stilted , it might knock your head off , if while you were listening you tried to actually digest it for its meaning . to enjoy one of these early science fiction thrillers , made before quality special effects became a sci-fi prerequisite , one must keep an open mind for how cheesy the film looks and have a special feel for low brow culture . this stuff ain't spielberg , it ain't even up to robin williams' low standards-- it's bad alright , but not that bad that it can't be laughed at ! please refrain from yodeling any uncalled for responses , upon learning that these outer space creatures have invaded switzerland , having just come from the andes . allen must be thinking to himself , give me proof , man , don't leave me hanging again , what are the other scientists going think of me ! don't tell me , professor , that you can't report it to the authorities yourself because you're a serious scientist , busy studying cosmic rays-- i'm serious , too ! when brett is cut after attacking anne he doesn't bleed , but he folds up like a cheap suit when allen puts a few slugs in his belly . at last , they come across the monster , and all i can say , it was smart of the filmmaker to wait till nearly the end of the film to see what they look like . rather than being scary , the monsters looks a lot like an overweight oprah , interviewing a political candidate from the right-wing and frowning at his politically incorrect responses with her one gigantic eye . there are no surprises in this film . if you see it , you know what kind of film you are getting . the crawling eyes may be a good film to see on late night cable tv while you are hoisting a few at the bar . in the film , everyone of the characters either has a brandy or a scotch to drink at some time , when shook up or about to climb the mountain or just to be sociable . therefore , they might know something about this film that others don't , that it might be best to have a few nips while viewing to enhance the quality of the film , not that i am an advocate of drinking , but what the hell . . . it children wouldn't need any artificial stimulants , the movie should be right on their level . i saw it sober , just for the record . so my grading of the film should be more favorably skewed for those who might be inclined to imbibe . 
i had an empty feeling seeing this film from its dripping blood onset , which was really the drippings from a raspberry sauce being poured over a fancy poultry dish , to its ambiguous ending ( where it is suggested that all the killings are in the psycho's head ) , and by the time the trick finale comes about , my empty feeling is just as prevalent as when i was bombarded by all the lists of toiletries the psycho prefers , his fancy squid ravioli with lemongrass sauce and arugula caesar salads in those upscale restaurants , and all the butchery that took place during the course of telling this president reagan era fable about yuppie greed , a slight variation on wall street's- " greed is good message . " i felt i was tricked once too often in this film , that with all its intended satire , it still ends up being a rather tasteless film that basically had not much of a point to it . this is , to say the very least , a disturbing film , even if it trimmed down on the novel's savagery and that the grisly killings take place mostly offscreen . it is a film about someone who is only human through his vices . while the film tries desperately to catch something about the psycho that an audience could sympathize with besides his good looks , but what results is that he can't be put together to look like a real person . and that is what becomes the main problem for the film , it is both creepy and sickly funny , but it offers no insights into a serial killer's mind-set that hasn't been said before . despite the film's glitzy photography , all the beautiful men in it , its various techniques used to make this a thought-provoking film , all fail to convince me that when all is said-and-done , this is not a sensationalized film , reveling in the subject's sickness and need for pornography and violence and consumerism . this is a superficial psychological comparison , and though it might sound good saying the two are alike , if you take the time to think about what is being said , it becomes easy to see that there are just as many similarities as differences between the two groups . the only other thing that i remember from the detective's role , is that dafoe has a deep , rich voice , as his part was miniscule and not very well thought out . the men in his life , all colleagues and look alikes , seem to be dressed-up as gentlemen but underneath that veneer , they are neanderthals . in one successful scene , that is an amusing satire on status among the corporate-types , his colleagues compare their business cards as to the texture of the paper and the quality of the printing . but the film's drawback , is that it is only about a general person and not about an individual , despite bale's tour-de-force performance and the aims of the director to get more out of the film than the book got . it still has an unpleasant subject matter to deal with and is only successful in making passing comments about a way of life that is easy to ridicule- the " me " generation . i might have liked the film better , if it had the balls to stick with its serial killer story , as difficult a task as that may have been , which is the heart of the story anyway , instead of yielding to so-called good-taste and accepting a lame hollywood cop-out ending ( which probably was a business decision more than an artistic one , since the film will now at least bring in some profit ) . the film left me with an empty feeling , by implying the psycho is still a psycho , even if the killings are not real . i certainly don't think music or books about serial killers makes them serial killers or do their repressed thoughts . i believe they are that way because they are driven by what's inside them that is uncontrollable and all that could be done in a film that is not made just for entertainment or exploitation , is to try and see if we can understand them a little better . i'm not sure if i can say that this film accomplished that and i'm not sure if i felt wholly entertained by the film , though the film was to its credit was not an exploitive one . yet , an empty feeling is what lingers , even long after i saw the film and try to recall it . other than the film looking good , being titillating in spots , being competently put together and well-acted , i don't think there is much else to say about it that is thought-provoking . 
petulia plays like a soap opera , set in san francisco during the late 1960s . it has a few gratuitous shots of janis joplin and big brother & the holding company plus the grateful dead , playing to a largely non-hippie audience . it is , indeed , mind-boggling to have so little acid rock in a film pretending to be about the mod '60s . the film reminded me most of a general hospital sudser , with a few noted nicolas roeg cinematography tricks , pre-performance , thrown in to give it a deeper look than the picture merited , such as jump cuts , time frame changes back and forth and forward , leaving one with a disjointed feeling about when events actually took place . the innovations , which make the film seem unconventional , all come about through the visual rhythm of the film rather than through the story itself . the good thing about david's parents , is that the father is joseph cotten and it's always great to hear his uniquely rich voice on the screen . there is no explanation for the continuous flashbacks and flash-forwards , as confusion reigns as a form of hipness . if you ask me , i thought this film was more claptrap than anything else . but enjoyable claptrap . it was easy to take , and even if the story didn't go anywhere , it did catch something unique about the 1960s that wasn't seen in other films -- how the wealthy took to the changes without the usual ways of rebelling . she had a craziness about her that made her pause to take stock of her life , but not enough to be a drop-out . a socialite's kookiness , will you . george c . scott looked grumpy for most of the film , but seemed to gain a little of the revolutionary spirit of the times every time he was with the kooky petulia . aside from the brilliant performances , this surreal-styled film , with its successful flashbacks but not so successful flash-forwards , was rather a disorientated and emotionally cold film . it was impossible to warm up to these elusive and neurotic characters , each trapped by fate or indecision . by the film's end , the same problems that existed in the beginning were still present . george c . scott is still chasing something that he is not sure of . they all have quirky personalities , but they are all straight and it seems odd that a film so grounded in the '60s actually missed having truly representative characters of that age . i thought the film was too cutely done and lacked depth . 
this chilling tale left a lot to be desired and despite having an intelligence and originality to it , it degenerated into a jejune work , more of a display of style over substance . i felt cheated by its wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality , feeling more like i was being manipulated than i was at being treated to something special . in a positive vein , this low-budget film kept moving at a swift pace and the story was conceivable to a point . the film managed to hold my interest until about the halfway point , when too much of the same interplay between dreams and reality was never made clear , so much so that i stopped suspending disbelief , which is tantamount to pulling the life support on one of these flicks and rendering it brain dead . the slogan for the product would be : the new you from eunice . it is further explained to martin , that these are numbers we do not want to get into anyone else's hands . the proposition is , that we get you a meeting with him and you get to do brain surgery on him , and if you can manipulate his thought process so we get the three numbers we need , fine . but if he should go brain dead , that's fine too . as loopy as the story is from here , it is the most sense it will make , because everything gets more confusing from here on , after martin visits the harmless but paranoic halsey in lakeside . there are also dreams within the dreams , adding more confusion , until the film ends on a dull conventional note , after all the expections of something radical being promised . the film didn't do much for me , as it was not worth putting in all the effort to watch it , as the payoff seemed too little . but the dream sequences were scary and the film had an intelligent approach to its horror rather than the usual exploitive one . . . if only it made more sense ! pullman seemed believable as someone losing sense of reality , while paxton was robotic in his role , playing it without feeling . all the other performances were as forgettable as the film . 
the other distinguished party in this revenge oater , is daniel b . ullman , a noted " b " western script specialist , whose unique stories were used in a multitude of westerns in that era . . . . if you want to see a western , one like they don't make anymore , this is as good a representative as most . 
quo vadis ? a glossy mgm extravaganza of a bible film , more pleasing to watch for its conspicuous opulence than for its dramatics , dialogue , or politics . petronius says of nero's lie , that people will believe any lie , if it is fantastic enough . quo vadis ? at the time , it was only second to gwtw in how much cabbage it brought in . it had a lot of spectacular shots and was well-paced , but it was not a particularly moving experience . one of the shots i preferred , was of nero looking through a a piece of green glass at an orgy while poppaea looked at it through a red glass . they had such different perspectives , you see . peter ustinov's delightful over-the-top sissy performance was fun to watch . they don't make them like this one anymore because it costs too much and the studios are not sure if the crowds will come again . 
he assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair and he also thinks , what could they do to me if i'm caught , i'm just a kid ! at the fair , the film breaksdown into a madcap thriller . unfortunately , only a few of marshall brickman's funny pearls get into the script . the one line i liked the best , is when lithgow is warning the kid about how tough the government agents could be when they grill you : " they'll lock you in a room and then they'll throw away the room . " the tense scene back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in most typical action films , but what makes this film a little bit different , is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear plants across america , even though this information is not widely known by the public . i use as my source of reference , for this information , dr . michio kaku , professor of theoretical physics , at ccny . so even if the film sunk rapidly into the pits of a pointless preachy exercise about nuclear dangers , there still was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists seen doing their job . and it was , at least , not one of those awful summer teenager movies . in fact , the acting was quite good in spots , especially , by christopher collet ; he convinced me he was a smart kid , while john lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart . 
she acts and looks a lot like gwyneth paltrow . the film runs needlessly on for over two hours and takes this story into many different areas concerning religious faith , personal goals , cultures , comedy routines , and romance , with too many themes for it to adequately cover . but this time with a slightly different twist ! the film spends a lot of energy going back and forth among these characters , trying to understand why they are all so upset . it shows him on two dates and both with results that were not as funny as they were intended to be . the film was only mildly pleasing for the following reasons : jenna elfman was too attractive and had too much of a sunny disposition for either rabbi or priest , therefore the romance part of the film never took off . the pace of the film was meandering , focusing too much attention on close-ups of jenna and the side-bar subplots that added nothing relevant to the story . the story itself , which tried to be cute and touch upon current controversies , added nothing new by its discoveries . the film stopped dead in its tracks when it took itself too seriously and a series of sermons were delivered about how ben stiller should resolve his love problem . for first-time director and all-around actor edward norton ( fightclub/ the people vs . larry flynt/ american history x ) , this was a curious film for him to choose to direct , since he chose one that is particularly lightweight , considering some of his acting roles have been in cutting-edge films , which makes you wonder where he's coming from . . the results are that the film is more awkward than controversial , more secular in spirit than religious , and it revisits grounds that are all too familiar and have been done far better by people like woody allen . that love wins out over faith , should surprise no one who has watched hollywood films over the years and how they love to give people the endings that make them feel-good , and most people feel-good when they see lovers who love each other be together in the end . the best one can say about this film , was that its heart was in a better place than its script . the worst that can be said about it , was that its responses to the controversies it brought up , were decided in too timid a way for the film to leave any impact . 
there are no surprises in this oater , but it's watchable fare . it is surprising how soothing these lightweight films can be and how nostalgic they are for those of us who sometimes have a yen to recall the 1950s , thinking fondly back when films such as this one were regularly part of a double-feature . there are villains galore here . my favorite portrayal of one is by jeff corey . as brett now sides openly with lane . these scenes are action-packed . there's nothing special about this oater , nor is there anything terrible about it . but , by golly , you get to see the cavalry come riding in to save the day , and to me , that's when you know for darn sure that you are watching a genuine western . 
a love letter to the cinema , as some well-known hollywood musical films are paid homage to , as well as orson welles' the magnificent ambersons , using the following quote from that film : " in those days they had time for everything . " the film is about his innocent autobiographical reflections , which are devoid of sentimentality and are emotially rich in seeing what influenced the child to be the kind of adult he became . what the film lacks in script and conventional production values , it makes up in poetical lyricism . what takes place on the screen is a series of close-ups of the child and allusions about the child's reactions to growing up , without any particular effort to tell a story . it makes for a different way of filmmaking , one that is plotless , that would have been marvelous if it weren't so boring at times . yet , there are shots that are memorable , making me want to applaud davies for the effort more than for the result . the film , like the reading of poetry , demands concentration on its visualizations and allows for the free translation of what is seen , as no explanations follow . the closing shot of the long day closes , is of a striking sunset in black & white images , which was very evocative , the suggestion being of how grinding this childhood period was for the child trying to come to grips with things , but now looking back at it , he can see all the beauty in it that was always there , and not the least , being the way his mother always had such a chipper attitude . there is a warm place in the film reserved for the standard contemporary pop music of the times , with such songs as " i don't know why i love you like i do " and , " at sundown , " which is sung by doris day ; judy garland sings " over the bannister " ; and , " tammy " is sung by debbie reynolds . " the major problem with this experimental film is not the poetry or the wonderful images seen , but that it is not a fulfilling cinematic experience because we don't get to know any characters in the film with any depth and we are more or less left with snapshot impressions of what bud experienced rather than feeling we know him better than that . for those who have fallen in love with art films , this one might be better suited to your taste than to the general public's . 
the film wavers between being a philosophical treatise on women and being about a woman's passions without resolving what any contemporary woman's magazine currently does ( this unresolvement can be seen in both a positive and a negative sense ) . the effort here is to push the film along shock value lines , of pushing it more into the lines of what a porno film does as routine . some of her revelations might surprise the opposite sex , as this film is helpful like a self-help book is meant to be . she makes no bones about it that she loves the carnal act . marie's best comment to this is , " why do men who disgust us , understand us best . " she seems to enjoy this perverse relationship , of being degraded , better than all her others , as we see her with robert in this situation twice . despite the film's coldness , lack of humor , bleak conceptions about relationships , unappetizing sexual scenes , lack of dramatic tension , and pretentious philosophizing by caroline ducey , it still had something disturbing to say about relationships that was worth listening to . for the director , sex is shown to be what fantasies are made of : that it is all in one's head . to show this , breillat her heroine be nude for many scenes and therefore symbolically stripped her of all the illusions she has about sex , as we watch her act out these fantasies . though the film might not always be appealing , it is still not a work of trash ; it does have something to say of what goes on in the marital bedroom . how much you like what it says might depend on what you thought it was digging at and if its romantic notions rang a bell in your head . my thoughts are that the film's presentation didn't particularly excite me , but afterwards it left me thinking about what it had to say about relationships , which are still just as great a mystery as god is , and i began to warm to the film more than while i was watching it . it , somehow , made me think more about the dark side of a relationship and for that reason alone , i wouldn't entirely dismiss this film , though i wonder at what it really was trying to get at . the body of the film's works is quite different than its ending , which shows ducey giving birth to a son and her womanhood supposedly being fulfilled . i think this is a film women might be more appreciative than men . 
a more than adequate telling of the standard-type of 1950s hard-nosed war film , which is helped greatly by an outstanding cast . throughout the film , starting at its opening moments , the patriotic " halls of montezuma " song is rousingly played whenever there is a call for flagwaving . lewis milestone , the director of this ode to war film , was curiously enough , noted for directing in 1930 , one of the most reknown anti-war films , all quiet on the western front . in " halls of montezuma , " milestone emphasizes the lives of the characters in the battle-tested 2nd marine company , rather than the battle scenes . in some battle scenes , the real documentary war shots are added to the film action , which gives the film a gritty look . the film doesn't pretend to be more than a routine ww11 war film reflecting the political mood of when it was made , that should be pleasing for those who like simple-minded action flicks . it is well-crafted by milestone's even-handed direction and it ably presents the characters of the men and lets the story build in action after a slow start , so that when some of the men die , you at least know who they were . 
this routine noir feature just doesn't cut it -- it's story is too implausible and it lacks proper tension . what gives this opening scene its noir look , is the shadowy photography james wong howe provides in scott's escape through the window . this whole scene was really unconvincing , but , nonetheless , he manages to continue to charm the mother ( servoss ) . but things happen very fast and hilda can't wait for that meeting . the story simply didn't add up , but its quick pace helped move things along , and faye emerson and zachary scott can always be counted on to give competent performances . but nothing can save this film from mediocrity , as the film made a febrile attempt to study a psychopath , but was restrained by the film's weak script and lacklustre directing effort . 
an entertaining nonsense film from aip , directed by the master of the meaningless , edward l . cahn . it is one of those mad scientist in the jungle movies , that is so bad , that it becomes funny to watch to see just how bad it is . there's some savagely inane dialogue , which should add a chuckle or two . he replies , " never say that again . " and with dialogue like that and cheap looking props , as the film was obviously shot as cheaply as possible in the studio , there is no reason in the world to take this flick seriously . it makes no attempt to make things look realistic , and its story doesn't even try to make sense . she says , " what's in it for you here , the usual ! if you can accept the film on it own low level terms , this studio jungle film might be your medicine . 
this howard hughes rko film first previewed with the title " i married a communist , " but this title did not strike a chord with the audience , so the title was changed and the story reworked so as to make it more of a palatable melodrama than just a vituperative attack on the communists . but it still remains to be seen as mostly a propaganda movie . he seems to have turned over a new leaf with this work experience -- as the film makes a concerted effort to show that work is good for you , that the bosses are benign , that the union can only succeed if it roots out the few commie operators in it who are trying to subvert its legitimate aims , that the communist party is the devil , and that you can't hide from your past mistakes -- so you better think about what you are doing before you sign up for a communist membership , because you can never get out of it once you join . the story was a lot of hokum and misinformation : it distorted the communist influence in the country and how big business and unions act . it attempted to make a propaganda film that reaffirms the american way of life and familial love , but at the expense of reality . if you can somehow get by the polemics and the cheesy script and view this melodrama as typical hollywood , the film is quite entertaining , as it is shot in a dramatic noir style by musuraca and the leads all give able performances , swallowing some of the most tasteless lines ever with a great deal of bravado . 
this thriller is directed by doug jackson ; it will best explore the fast-paced business world and its sterile atmosphere , where not telling the truth or stretching the truth in different ways is the norm . it succeeds in capturing that frenetic yuppie need for material things and how that greed blinds the quality of life . but what it fails to do , is build a mystery that goes beyond what could be read in the newspapers . you get a few spine tingling moments out of the heroine's self-made misfortunes and a surprise twist in the ending , but you don't get a lasting sense that this isn't all manufactured tension to fit too neatly into its premise of how anyone can be a victim of a random act of violence and have their life put through the ringer . his most revealing comment is , " i love to surround myself with beautiful things . i love beautiful women , smart , and powerful women . " the the film became difficult to watch from here on . it was hard too warm up to her plight , though it was remotely possible to see how she got into this messy situation . the script was too thin and had to be padded with too many non-involving scenes . the film annoyed me more than it enlightened or entertained me . there didn't seem anything special about the acting and too many of the secondary characters were put in there as props to echo the director's point he was making of greed influencing corporate decisions . it didn't have the suspense of a hitchcock film , instead it had more the look of a second-rate movie made for tv , which could be entertaining for a late night audience that is not that demanding . 
siegel misfired with this mild western comedy . the film was hampered by a dull story and an uninteresting performance by shirley maclaine playing a nun hiding the fact that she's a prostitute . a typical eastwood cowboy scene , played in clint's graceful languid style , as he puffs on his cigar , quietly snarls , and does what the filmmaker hopes most in the audience would love to do in real-life . once inside , they machete the soldiers , make them into human torches , or just shoot them . it's all predictable and formulaic ; it could have used a big time rewrite . 
this is carl reiner's cleverly adapted spoof on noir films of the post-world war11 days . the comedy film relies on creative editing of the classics of the forties , somehow including a host of stars from bogart to cagney to ava , as part of its story . any scene could have martin conversing with someone like a cary grant or a veronica ladd , or being shot at by alan ladd . this is basically a one-idea film , and that idea , although cleverly worked out as far as special effects , begins to run dry after a while , as the story lags in character development . but enough's enough ! what keeps the film hopping are some very funny quips and some dumb bon mots that were infantile but amusing . 2 because it smelled like that number . if you've seen " the bribe , " you've got the rest of the film's story , as the reiner team ran out of ideas and winged the ending the lazy way , with old film clips . nazis and cheese go together in this film like vincent price to villainy . a knowledge of some of the more popular noir classics like the big sleep , double indemnity , and suspicion , might help in soaking up the films' nostalgia . the overall effect is not bad for a few belly laughs and to marvel at the skills of 1980s technology , but no cuban cigar for the film , as the story went up in smoke somewhere over the hills of hollywood . 
a routine aip action-packed ww11 drama of heroism . if you like a no-nonsense war story of all action , no big-name stars , and one that validates courage . . . you got it in this solid low-budget actioner . 
a breezy , screwball comedy about police , with a slightly different twist , it is about nyc's bureau of missing persons . so the story's not perfect ! but this was a fun programmer , fast-paced and a typical warner bros . potboiler of that time period . 
a taut little suspense programmer . one that is very watchable , though the twist in the plot is hardly believable . it's not believable that a hardened hitman would confess so easily , but he does . . . what this potboiler had going for it , was a nice look to its b&w shots of the dark streets of london , and through sydney tafler's melodramatic performance , it showed how a killer can be cold-blooded taking care of business and yet be a devoted family man and , though his love for his brother was genuine , it was still misguided . overall , the " b " film had good production values and a satisfying but improbable story to tell . 
we know we are watching a shaft movie without even looking up at the screen , as we tune into the wah-wah funk sound of isaac hayes' exponential title theme and get with its raucous sounds that echo throughout this action-packed mainstream movie from the opening credits to the film's end . john singleton's ( " boyz n the hood " ) " shaft " is a blaxploitation sequel film to the core , made in earnest for the urban new millennium and to satisfy its fans who have followed all the other shaft films . why do we need another " shaft , " is easy to explain : the public demands it , meaning there's big box office potential . his humor is of the vulgar kind , where he tells a barmaid , " it's my duty to please the booty . " the film has its two eyes firmly set on the box office , its mind in the gutter , and a serviceable script for all its mayhem and profanity to have an urban gritty feel to it . the film makes only a few halfhearted pretences of being anything more than a mindless entertainment spectacle , and those efforts don't help but hinder . the film would have been better served if went completely either for mindless violence or played it completely like a scorsese art-form gangster film . mixing in both styles , only jarred the rhythm of the film . it also had the audience where i saw the film , charged-up for the action scenes and hooting with wild delight at the snide digs . the meeting of great minds , of the hateful wasp walter and the stereotyped lowlife peoples , who speaks a stream of constant trash-talk and with an enunciation that is so fantastically off kilter , that makes it fun to laugh at him . the comedy provided by wright's speech pattern is comparable to a cisco kid movie dialogue , if the two stars were on speed . his role is very serious . he's limited in this lifetime by his ethnic quirks . the film resorts to violent chases , shootouts , a final duel between wright and jackson , and a twisted ending , to make its final statement about what singleton thinks of the justice system . it is stylishly directed and acted , and achieves moderate success in telling its story . it even offers some passing comments about a host of recent nyc police corruption cases , and it can't resist a passing aside at the current mayor , as jackson in the middle of an assault on the drug dealers says , " it's giuliani time . " this film was made for samuel l . jackson ; just by his presence , it makes this film a more perplexing one than the others . what is missing is any love interest or any sex scenes ; what takes the place of sex , is pure violence . you tell me if that's an improvement ! 
the dinner game is such a scenario . some might find this fast-moving play to be smart and witty . but i didn't . he does that mainly through phone conversations , whereby he has a knack for saying the wrong thing and making things worst . jacques villeret is an appealing fool , whose good-heart shines throughout the farce , even though he proves to be a true numbskull . there were a few laughs to be had , but this is really tv sitcom material and not great wit . 
there have been very few films about the american revolution and most of them have been terrible , with the exception of d . w . at least , they kept it moving at a brisk pace , but , unfortunately , they used a good deal of violence . there were a multitude of choreographed battle scenes , face-to-face combat scenes , and sweeping panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside , which should take your mind off all the empty messages of the film . the filmmaker even made slavery appear as not such a bad thing by having the slaves seem more like workers than slaves , they just seemed to be having themselves a good old time on the plantation . when the 158-minutes are up , you might not have much of an historical perspective of the war , but you should feel good that the arch villain got his just desserts . the colonel's villain role is about as one-dimensional and predictable as it gets for such a villain , whereby he becomes more cartoonish and less menacing as the story rolls on . and there you have the plot , which is not much on history and not much on character development . everything is so predictable about this glossy photographed film , everything is so banal , everything seems so dishonest , and the dialogue is so disparaging , that i found this to be such a morbid attempt at history , such a futile way to tell a story . everything from the acting and the script was flat . everyone was reduced to a cardboard figure , and the war seemed to be a manufactured one , as if this film was made as a tv episode . the story lacked vitality , only scoring points for its fine costumes and john williams musical score . the film always seemed to be an unhealthy mixture of mawkishness and carnality , offering nothing but shallow responses for all its preaching about freedom . only this film comes with some bogus history lesson thrown in , which makes it more shamefully exploitive , a " payback " with the redcoats as the gangsters . i had an ugly feeling when i left the theater , like someone was trying awfully hard to sell me on patriotism : using children , the flag , a horrid villain , all to shamelessly stir me up , instead of telling me a story about a credible character who got involved in the war for independence . 
drew pearson narrates the opening of the film , despairing about slums as the cause of juvenile delinquency . drew pearson's serious voice gives this film a documentary look ; and , when we see the gang in action , it is remindful of all those dead end kids' feature movies . this is a tired , clich ? d film , with its main selling point being all the location shots of the city , evoking a sense of urban nostalgia . tony curtis made his film debut , taking a small part as one of the amboy dukes . all the gang members are stock characters and the predictable story sheds little insight about juvenile delinquency , offering only a square look into the grimness of street life . this film lost everything about the novel that was essential , and the robotic acting didn't help . the only thing diverting about the film was some of the odd touches : the candystore lady insulting her customers while dispensing egg creams , and one of the dukes called crazy ( shelley ) , who is thinking about ordering ice cream mixed with french fries and potato salad , musing that it should taste good together , after all he likes all those foods separately . 
a very familiar crime story , one that has been often done in recent times , about a rough irish neighborhood and the hoods who can't escape from it . first-time director john shea has made this independent low-budget film , that is long on gritty atmosphere but short on substance . it's a violent film , where action speaks louder than words . there doesn't seem to be a point to this film , except to show some tough guys in action , and how difficult it is to stop old habits . the acting is good enough and the background music , a mixture of rap , rock , and celtic sounds , evokes a sense of irish doom . but , the story fails to build any drama into it , and everything seems too bleak . it is an easy film to take on its terms , if you want to take a look at such a dead-end of possibilities and watch a dysfunctional family spin out of control . it reminded me of " monument ave . , " which covered the same territory . it was just too difficult to understand how that could happen considering the hatred between these two is known throughout the community and how danny swore he wouldn't do anything dishonest anymore . there are no surprises here , everything goes down a path to nowhere . since the film has no final note to end on , it uses the st . paddy's day parade to have its final shot--which is tantamount to waving the flag to indicate patriotism , or in this case , irish pride . 
i was never a comic book fan , though as a child i was a casual reader of such comics as archie , batman , and superman . i have never read x-men , which was created in 1963 , or for that matter too many other comic books as an adult , and therefore do not view this $75 million special-effects dominated film with the same reverence that an aficionado of such sci-fi fantasy comics would . i'm just interested to see how fox's new comics-to-film adaptation presents itself , as i found very few such projects turn out to be worthwhile films . the results here are only tepid , as far as entertainment value goes . other than that , i had no interest to see if the filmmaker made a travesty of the sacred comic book , as i'm certain x-men geeks will carefully scrutinize that aspect of the film more than i will care to . it is a commercial film , geared to be a summer blockbuster , also hoping to cash in on selling its merchandising wares to its young fans , and cashing in down the road with a number of sequels . its special effects were , at times , dazzling , but i'm not partial to high tech films without too much else going for it , especially for a superhero film that seemed as awkward as this one was . i only ask : why was the filmmaker so sober-minded about filming this comic book story film ? what seems tiring about it , is all the other characters in the film who are given quality time and end up just showing us their supernatural gifts and halloween-like costumes before disappearing from any further characterizations . the story , before it reached its action climax on the statue of liberty at ellis island , where the world leaders are convening , hit a lot of tired spots , where the movie seemed to be more or less a promo for more sequels than one that could sustain its own story . the premise of x-men is -- that its heroes are mutants -- homo superior beings -- the next evolutionary stage for human beings , who are discriminated against because they're strange . for most of the film , we are introduced to the opposing sides of this good versus evil duel . he can scale walls and has a 12-foot projectile tongue . wolverine is a hothead , a loner , and the existential hero of this film . his claws project out rapidly from his knuckles and can cut through almost anything . it is obvious that singer developed a love for this comic book story and its mutants , but he failed to distance himself from it and ended up with a ponderous , uninteresting film , that failed to get to the heart of any character in the story , and left the story hanging by its special effects , which made the film seem dried out long before its action scenes took hold . it was only mildly diverting as far as entertainment value and that is because of the welcomed hammy performances by stewart and mckellen . i'm sure that regular fans of the comic book will find some inside jokes in the film to laugh at , but i just tended to grow weary of the effort and was not converted to the x-men project . the film needed a healthy share of irreverence to rev me up for all this righteously moralistic stuff it lays on you . 
this disney presentation of a time travel fantasy tale has the good sense not to try and spend too much time clearing up what theoretical scientists say is impossible : it is not possible to go back to the past and change history . " the kid " is a children's story but is stretched into an adult one as well . it is usually through dreams , drugs , one's creative work , psychoanalysis , or meditation that one looks back at their past , but bruce is too blocked for any of that . if one were to overlook all the impossibilities about this story and just concentrate on how the bruce willis character comes to resolve his problem , then the film is somewhat engaging . though , it is sad to say that he resolves his problem the typical macho way , by beating up his nemesis . the movie was ably directed by jon turtletaub ( while you were sleeping/phenomenon ) and written by audrey wells ( the truth about cats and dogs ) . it has a balanced mixture of adult sentimentalities and childish comedy that should bring both children and adults into the same movie theater , each finding something in the film to experience together . the idea of the film is intriguing , of a man who will live his future as he knows he should because he got to the bottom of what troubled him when he was growing up , and though the story is impossible and the self-absorbed bruce is now learning to be nice to those close to him that he has hurt before , seemed like a stretch , it is still a family-fare film with a few more ideas thrown in than the usual disney flicks . though this type of supernatural movie has been tried often ( back to the future/frequency/12 monkeys ) , this film had a nice quality to it , making it rather special . bruce willis works very well with children , he seems to be a natural , and all his previous films with children also attest to this , including his recent supernatural thriller " the sixth sense . " 
a mindless psychological thriller set in vermont , that starts out in a promising mysterious fashion but ends badly , ruining any credibility it might have generated . it tries very hard to be both a mystery and a supernatural story , but it goes off course on both its aims way before it sinks to its low abyss . it was a film that was all foreplay but couldn't come to a climax , and as the film started to clear up the mystery mood it created while moving at its snail pace , the revelations of the mystery weren't worth exploring . the only thing the film did well , was provide a lot of schlock . the result is a dull film , with uninteresting and poorly developed characters , and too many manipulative fright scenes that i have seen before in too many other horror flicks . the only thing this film did really well aside from all its schlock setups , was photograph the lakeside lake champlain area and use the champlain bridge for some eerie shots . the story seemed to drag from the onset , as the director wasted time taking irrelevant long shots aimed to be frightening and then turning away from those shots without drawing anything out of them ; it should have been an eighty minute film , like the b- movies of the 1950s , and then it might have been a more tolerable venture . robert zemeckis ( " forrest gump " / " contact " / " back to the future " ) is such an emotionally empty director , his characters seem more like robots than humans , that the movie seems to be such an effort in draining the life out of it that it becomes mostly a special effect movie with characters becoming secondary in importance . zemeckis has built a story around a lady-in-peril , one with too much idle time , who is overwrought with a healthy dose of neurotic tension , talking herself into thinking she sees ghosts , but who doesn't know how to internalize that fright . michelle pfeiffer is asked to carry this film , but without an adequate script , even if she is a good casting decision for that role , her task is too difficult to accomplish . the last shocking scene takes place in a bathtub , one that could have been ordered from the sears catalogue before world war 11 , and seems to be ready-made for a horror flick . if this is supposed to be like a hitchcockian thriller , then why wasn't i thrilled by what i saw ! zemeckis has created an unaffecting haunted house thriller , with samples from many other films thrown into this derivative stew , but nothing seems to work here . this is just a boring movie about a couple that are as unreal as the ghosts in their house . 
this innocent comedy from spain just didn't have enough impact to hit a home run with its humor . it probably has more relevancy for its native audience ( at least , i hope it does ) , as most of its tv sitcom sketches just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna . the film's main asset is its popular star , carmen maura , considered by many spanish film critics to be spain's most accomplished actress . if you like that sort of comedy , then you might like this film . the story is probably autobiographical : the heroine ( carmen maura ) is a journalist named carmen , and the film is layed out in four sections , just like a newspaper , but here the divisions relate to the time of season . all the fights are mild and over the most trivial of things , which is supposed to make this very materially comfortable couple look ridiculous , since it is obvious that they have so much going for them that there is no reason for them to be fighting all the time . she then tells him , " the watch only looks expensive , it was really quite cheap . " somehow the film flew by , aided by its breezy pace , non-stop banter , and the lightheartedness of its direction . it was a sweet , palpable , likable little domestic comedy , similar to what american audiences saw on tv in the 1950s and 1960s ( except for the nudity and frank sexual talk ) . carmen maura put on a good show , outwitting the episodic script and coming to terms with her great mid-life crisis in a pleasing manner . it's a mild film , with mild comedy , and mild points to make about domestic relations . it is deserving of mild praise for its execution . 
what i didn't need was australian director/writer of " cedars , " scott hicks ( " shine " ) , to tell me what a bad thing the internment of japanese americans during world war ii was for a little over two hours of a darkly photographed film and then precede to bore me to death with a glum romantic/courtroom drama , that never got untracked , but seemed so proud of itself for being so politically correct in taking a stand against bias . all the film's great social themes and plays on morality , were too docile and too manipulatively inflated to hold my interest . the first part of the film , just stagnated , as uninvolving flashbacks filled the screen and uninteresting storytelling techniques prevailed , without fleshing out the reality of the characters except to see them in wooden terms . everything seemed so contrived , the film had no fresh air to breathe , the cinematography was darkly uninspiring , the courtroom seemed to be staged only as a reason to give the filmmaker his chance to applaud himself for being so free of bias . everything seemed so mechanical : the acting , the story , and the directing ; everything was so dutifully right , the film left me asleep in the cedars , as i was unable to see what the fuss was about in telling americans that their country shamefully put japanese americans in internment camps during the war . what's the surprise ? 
matthew harrison's " kicked in the head " has its offbeat comical moments but in the end dies from self-indulgence and too much cuteness . kevin corrigan wrote a juicy part for himself , but his part never caught fire , in fact , he was the film's weakness . the supporting characters were at least funny when they did their shticks in this rambling , derivative nyc movie , that tried too hard to be offbeat and in the process forgot it would be nice to have a story that made some sense to go with the film . when she does that , it is good for a few laughs . the film gets trapped in too many scenes that don't work . another is the unlikely romance taking place between corrigan and fiorentino , which seemed out of context , and added nothing to the story , except it was more pleasant watching fiorentino perform than it was in watching corrigan . she was so much better than him , that it made me scratch my head and wonder what he was doing there . her character was all the more compelling than his , even though she had such a small part . nothing seemed to really work well here , yet all the supporting characters seemed to be pleasant and trying their best to make things work . but the film was too much of a childish fantasy on the part of corrigan , and the dialogue was too flip . it was one of those films that you might find enjoyable if you are in the right frame of mind for watching actors improvise their way out of a bad script , or if you are stoned like the connoisseur participants in " ape " film conversation were . 
the problem with epics of this grand design , is they could never be dramatic enough and fall prey to episodic incidents to tell their story . that is the case here , as the story was leaden and didn't seem to move , as it plodded along linear lines and political regimes , from monarchy to fascist and finally to communist regimes . the filmmaking , though well-intentioned and intelligently presented , was just too dull and uninspiring to sustain interest in the lesson it is trying to teach about the mess bigotry and politics makes , even if the lesson is an important one and shouldn't be ignored . the film was also bereft of any subtlety , its messages were of the kind that hit you over the head with a loud thud . there are a few scenes that stand out because they were either so awkward , or because they had a raw power in them that was not found in the rest of the film . the drivel that comes out of that dialogue goes something like this : " i love you . . . but the point being made , in all the belabored efforts of the filmmaker , is that political regimes , materialism , and all causes are temporary , and that religions tend to be divisive . the film shows how assimilation can't work , changing your name can't work , being a good family and trying to be loyal to an oppressive regime can't work , passivity can't work , there is nothing that the jew can do to make those who hate him like him . i felt drained after seeing this epic , not from joy , but from weariness of all the messages i was receiving . he goes on to say , " i predict this will be a century of love , justice and tolerance . " this was the only irony found in the film , a film that just couldn't get its complex view across on what went went wrong for the jew in the anti-semitic world of austria-hungary , without being a drudge . 
a too obvious derivative supernatural thriller , most imitative of " rosemary's baby , " but without the same fresh intensity and without a credible script . what it had going for it , was a sleek look ( the cinematography was simply out of this world ) and an able workmanlike craftsmanship . rand ravich does a fine job directing his initial film , but fails miserbly with the storytelling part of his script . this results in a film that is watchable but not believable . in this arty mystery , which doesn't have too much mystery if you watched a few of these supernatural films before , spencer and streck come back different men from what they were before they experienced the two minutes of mystery . without a mystery to end on , the film becomes banal , having established no point of view and having nothing to say about space travel , it just becomes a predictable guessing game of how jillian will defend herself against her husband , someone who is really not her husband . 
this film is all style and is non-judgmental in its observations , adding nothing more of subtance to the story than the inertia that is depicted . there is violence everywhere in this stupid household . the film had realistic performances from its leads and had a gritty look to it . but the story flattened out and with violence being the loudest emotion expressed by anyone in this loser's family , the story predictably ends on a very violent note . the film makes no comments about the conditions of a society that helped bring about such anti-social behavior and what circumstances kept the family incapicitated . this first feature by woods , based on a work that was presented on stage , had its powerful moments , making a strong case about how male insecurity and violence are so closely linked . but the film couldn't get further into its subjects than to expose the boys' surface wounds and their bleak story about their frustrations to deal with life , as the story just went nowhere but down a predictable violent path . it left the implication that society better be prepared to build more jails or else , implying that there is no way to help a family that won't even lift a finger to help itself . 
wild party , the ( director : dorothy arzner ; screenwriters : from a story by warner fabian ; /e . a zesty college girls film , that is trashy fun , with the trash part of the film being very mild and the wild party being rather tame . despite its limitations , this film is a curious curio , it is mostly interesting to watch clara bow , the " it " girl , a superstar from the silents make her entrance into talkies and have the longtime editor for paramount pictures , dorothy arzner , be given the opportunity to direct that studio's first talkie . instead , he treats her curtly , not amused by her lack of work , lecturing her in class about her poor work habits . march's rationalization is , if i have to pass her , i'll pass all the other idiots in the class , as his main concern is that his course will now become known as an easy one . march's attitude about the college is summed up with this rejoinder to clara , " no more morons but plenty of savages . " this film can't be taken seriously , as its moral tone is questionable , its depiction of college life absurd , and its characterizations are all trivialized . but the film was snappy , a frivolous vehicle for the very appealing , good-time girl clara , who comes through with a heart of sweetness , while march shows he is more serious about the jungle than the university . 
this is an awkward comedy made just before kurosawa's breakthrough film , rashomon . but hiruta is not reliable , as he explains himself , saying people used to take advantage of him and laugh at his weaknesses , so he now uses trickery on them and doesn't care about ethics . the film switches tracks , as the two leads are not particularly interesting types , but the flawed hiruta makes for a more compelling story , so he becomes the main focus of the film . the courtroom is filled with contrivances , as the story befits a tacky soap opera . you can't beat that for pouring on the goo ! supposedly this film is a parody of the japanese willingness to accept america's foreign culture as theirs . kurosawa is an overrated director outside of shooting an action film , who can't shoot a dramatic film without laying on an overdose of goo . here he has mifune and the concert singer become sexless , while the publisher becomes a stock cardboard villain , and the lawyer's fall and redemption are just too predictable to have any effect . there is something caustic in this story , but its overall effect is ruined by too much that is an obvious delineation of what is good and evil . i found the message awkwardly delivered and unconvincing , and the acting was especially bad , as the lines as rendered seemed to be mechanical and not instinctive , it was as if all the actors attended a school for bad actors and learned to act by being didactic . this film hardly had a pulse , just a message it kept sending out in a not too subtle way . 
i expected this film , given its clich ? subject matter , to be worst than it turned out . in fact , it had its moments in the snow of actually looking like pure cinema . jacques tourneur should be credited for making this wartime propaganda piece into an acceptable action film , shunning politics for a typical hollywood wartime heroics and romance story . the film presented new and unknown actors , and only one of them , in his first motion picture , after appearing on the broadway stage , gregory peck , had any kind of star quality . need i say more on how she got the part ! but to her credit , she handled the role decently . this film was a ringing tribute to our wartime allies , the noble soviets . this would be a source of embarrassment in the coming years . the film predictably plods along to its climax , as nina delivers a message to the russian general in the field and he gives her a coded message , which is the one peck was waiting for , as he gets just as excited about the message as he does about holding nina in his arms . the film failed miserably with the critics and at the box office , but it wasn't that bad . . . it even had a certain corny charm to it that some might find appealing . 
everything seen is what has become a clich ? for this genre . i missed you . the film ends smoothly like those mystery shows on tv do : with a car chase that seems to be obligatory filler for such cop films , a rescue coming just in the nick of time , and the action scenes being well choreographed to fit the pyrotechnical finale . the attempt to bring any psychology into this thriller , never materializes , except in the most banal manner . in fact , the killer is more interested in playing mind games with spader than he is in killing his victims , which convinced me that this film wasn't looking to go into new territory with this 'let's make a profit for the producers' genre film . this debut feature by the music video director joe charbanic is a limited venture , smacking of formula questions and answers to the serial killer's mental state , resulting in a picture that is decidedly painted by-the-numbers . james spader as the lead , most of his career a fine actor , has difficulty doing anything with his uninteresting and predictable role , except go with the props he's been handed . the film covers up its banal story by some pretty slick shooting devices , which include fast-paced editing and jump-cuts , and at times , when taking on the killer's point of view , making the beautiful color go grainy with a hand-held video camera , which is meant to signify that there is some kind of mystery going on . what the sleek looking film accomplishes , is that it makes this hollow film very watchable , looking much like an mtv video . the film ultimately fails because the story is never drawn out enough to make it spellbinding or tense , the main characters are both too hackneyed to bring something to the table except an exercise in playing a role that goes against their film career typecasting . 
this lighthearted fantasy asks , what if the idealist h . g . wells didn't just write about the time machine but lived it ! it's mainly an emotionally flat , one running joke type of lightweight literary film that is done in by a very dull middle section and too much unnecessary gore . the director-writer nicholas meyer ( star trek 11 ) -- he also wrote the witty novel " seven percent solution " -- worked the screenplay from his own novel , showing some clever touches here and there , but not enough to hold my interest for the duration of the film . the theme grew tiresome and david warner as jack the ripper never developed as a particularly interesting villain . there was nothing gained by seeing him hold a scalpel to a woman's throat and then slit it . if you don't have the key , you can't return . in san francisco , there are some amusing moments as the naive wells has to adjust to the modern complexities of the world and its hustle and bustle . he seems adorably old-fashioned and gentlemanly , with a very stand-offish british wit , while she's an aggressive woman's libber , a modern california-type of lady , and an admirer of british eccentrics who are straight . it just advanced in technology but regressed into a more violent state than ever before . the film has many plot holes and flaws , one of them is : that it is not possible to go back in time and change history , all one can change is something that is only a duplicate , even if you think you are changing something , you are only deceived by appearances . albert einstein mentioned that about time travel and that's good enough for me . the jack the ripper part of the story never really worked as a thriller , it all seemed too heavy and misplaced , i am certain the film could have been salvaged if it kept with the fantasy/romance story between amy and wells . that part of the film was amusing and gave way to some interesting insights about the modern world . the film suffered from being too poorly presented , as it always appeared less than exciting , nevertheless it was occasionally diverting , and some cult sci-fi fans might like it more than the general public should . 
this is a lame coming-of-age film , yet michael corrente directs it with great sympathy for the characters , taking a lighthearted approach to some mild rebellion going on in the mid '70s , contrasting the lifestyles of both working-class and upper-class students . it comes to the 'startling' conclusion that rich kids might do the same bad things working-class kids do , but get away with it because their money gives them privileges . the film plays as if it's a slogan for " stupid pride . " at the school , he meets all the stock characters you would expect in such a formulaic film . better bongs . in the silliness that goes for either comedy or dramatics , which wasn't funny or enlightening , just stupid and incredible , dunph goes to the brown university dean and pleads for jane to be taken back , supposedly proving that he learned something about personal responsibility at the prep school . the problem with all these resolutions were that all the characters were clich ? s , no one's character was fleshed out , and this film based loosely on peter farrelly's life , never got untracked . the story might have been a heartfelt one for the author , who is the co-director with his brother bobby of " there's something about mary , " but it had little impact on film and was very much underwritten . there was just no story to get into which was worth getting into , nor were any of the characters in the least bit interesting . it all seemed like a futile effort to catch something about class status that had already been caught in a better light by recent films like " rushmore " and " slums of beverly hills . " 
this very bitter film , a retread of " the blue angel , " might appeal to fans of the great french actress jeanne moreau , in one of her best performances ever , who plays eva with a true intensity . she is the soul of the film , making this dark and improbable story have some teeth to bite into . it is filmed in a coldly sweeping baroque style . the jazzy musical score is by michel legrand , and the great billie holiday song " weep for me , " is most appropriate for the down mood the film idles on from beginning to end . the principal characters were simply not only not likable , lovable , or even cordial , they are personifications of a destructive god , willing to take not only themselves down , but anyone else who gets in their way . the story itself is the film's problem , because it is so unsettling and foolishly perverse , that it never promises any sunlight , so what is seen in the film's first fifteen minutes is exactly what you get by the finale , in a film that drags on for too long , coming to no point but trying its best to bring you down with its sour look at life . the only kind thing that can be said about the femme fatale , is that she's upfront with him . this scathing romance , which abstains from love , instead it favors romance as being something that darkly possesses you , as the flawed protagonist leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth . it's film that basically is asking two unanswerable questions : how do you explain a woman's love for a guy who is no good ? losey lets the pessimistic mood of the story prevail as his answer . . . 
if one were to applaud the effort . will pretentious crap do for a succinct review of the film ! it is more of a joke than a serious film , as all it tries to do is push the boundaries of technical innovation , while it neglects the basics of movie making : character development and the telling of a good story . shot on digital video in real time , with four hand-held cameras filming four different split screens , allowing the viewer to pick his poison as to which screen to watch , the narrative is told without any cuts , therefore no editor is needed . one of the screens has a louder volume , indicating that is the one the director thinks we might be more interested in watching . this soap opera story is about the lives and loves of sundry people connected to a hollywood production company , as they cast for their latest film project , which it turns out , is similar to the film just seen . well , at least , there should be something said about honesty in recognizing the worth of the product produced . the filmmaker's attempt here , is to make a stinging satire on hollywood and himself . timecode , under the pretense of being innovative , gets a big studio to take a chance on producing it , which doesn't mean it's worthwhile . the film was most like one of those stationary camcorder sites that they have on the internet , of say , some street corner , where the viewer hopes the time he spends is not wasted and something spontaneous will unfold to make it worth his while . at various times , the obvious symbolism of an earthquake is used as an artificial means to shake up all the characters in the quadrant . it was awkwardly done , seemingly ruining whatever natural effect was aimed for in telling this story in real time . i just couldn't get interested in this experimental film , finding it dizzying to watch and i was also hampered by its lack of wit and lack of spontaneous outrageousness . " timecode " just couldn't translate its sense of fun to the viewer , at least it couldn't to me . as for the technical feats attempted , maybe a more innovative filmmaker could make something of this format that wasn't done right here . other than that , this plays mostly as a novelty film , one to see because it's part of movie history . 
there was a worm in the core of this turgid thriller that spoiled its taste . the moody production of smilla's sense of snow is adapted from peter hoeg's best-seller . this is a film with so much unrealized potential , about the icy heroine of the story , the tough-minded half-american and half-greenland inuit , smilla jaspersen ( julia ormond ) , who seemingly stepped into a hole in the ice before the film's finale and was ludicrously transformed from a captivating noir personality to a typical hollywood action heroine . smilla's sense of snow presents a mysterious story relying on tense local atmosphere , enigmatic characters and twists in the plot , to spin its dark tale of a heroine looking to find her roots again . the danish director , bille august , who tries to be faithful to his fellow countryman's source material , presents a glossy and sleek looking film that inherits all the virtues and vices of the book , and comes up short in the end because it cannot overcome how utterly ludicrous the story becomes . the film opens as a meteorite , in the greenland of 1859 , hits the ice and crushes everyone in the vicinity , including an inuit fisherman , putting on a spectacular light show in the crushed ice , reminding me of the pyrotechnics one would see at a july 4th celebration . what should strike the audience as even stranger is how the film ends up in the same ice caves where the film opened up its story in the 19th century . this is how one would do it in a formulaic hollywood film , thereby putting a damper on the terrific mood the film had just set . it was sort of like going to dinner and getting a whiff of some sensual aromas and looking at some appetizing food on display , but when getting down to the heart of the meal with great anticipation , suddenly discovering the meal is just not edible . if you can be satisfied with just the atmosphere and not the story or any character being developed adequately , then you might feel adequately nourished by what you saw . i wasn't . i was just swept away by the moody setting , the fine stoic performance by ormond , and the potential for intrigue -- which , unfortunately , never materialized as it could have . 
the film's subject is the search for ideal love . it is the second feature of writer-director cameron crowe ( say anything . this fluff film fails to be absorbing because it is so sugary and forgettable , but with that being said , it still had a few tender moments that seemed worth while . there was nothing special about their up and down relationship , as it was very predictable . bridget fonda and matt dillon are a more interesting pairing . sheila kelley's stock character is sketchy and dull , of one who will do anything to get a man . the videographer is " batman " director tim burton . the grunge rock scene was fun to watch , the characters were more likable than not , there was a lot of tenderness shown for those who get hurt in relationships , and the film is emotionally as sweet as pie . the director is good at getting at light comedic moments , but has nothing much to say that is more serious . this is not an engaging film , and its whimsical story and clich ? characters did not hold my interest . the film was just too mild in attitude and tame in spirit . it is really a youth oriented film , with trite sayings which sound terribly out of place , such as when one of the characters says , " being alone , there is a certain dignity to it . " the film could be best enjoyed for its soundtrack , which includes the music of soundgarden , mudhoney , alice in chains and pearl jam in the background . 
a very obvious melodrama about the relationship of a southern-white trash mother-daughter . the story is not the thing here , but the unflappable , zesty performance janet mcteer gives , as she becomes absorbed in her part and plays it with emotional force , carrying this picture for all its worth . my problem with the film , is that it didn't absorb me in its story . i just thought the mother-daughter were likable and the film was pleasant , but not far-reaching . 
mr . cahn , in this aip cheapie , provides some amusing hokum exploiting the occult-horror b-film genre in a very hollywood type of way . the act has so far earned them $250 , 000 a piece . the cahn way of filming these seances is more funny than scary . this is strictly lightweight nonsense , which should be good for a few laughs . it is perfect viewing as a saturday matinee . i can't see anyone taking this one seriously . 
a routine ww11 submarine action picture , featuring an unknown cast , though in a few years the film's star , james caan , was to get his breakthrough role in " the godfather . " the subs are 51 feet long , weigh 35 tons , and have a depth of 300 feet , and will take a four-men crew . half of the film concerns the serious training the men undergo under the watchful eye of the stern bolton . the usual war film clich ? s are present in large doses . a watchable but forgettable film , with nothing in it that is distinguishable . it's a well crafted actioner with a terse and fast-paced story , and should be acceptable for those who don't mind that the movie is a clich ? . 
what can you say about this set in baltimore film , by the king of bad taste , john waters , except it is what can be expected from the director whose type of rebellious childish low-budget indie films have now become passe since his peak days of the 1970s , when he made " pink flamingos . " now his satire has become more tame than outrageous . it is ironic that the director made a film railing about the poor quality of a hollywood film and has made a film that is equally as bad , if not worst . this is a shoddy production , the comedy is lame , the acting almost non-existent , and the satire is sophomoric , taking pop shots at an easy target such as hollywood , but shots that have no sting . if i laughed more , then i could have found some justification for the film . at best , this " demented " could be seen as a tv sketch on " saturday night live , " or a straight to video movie release . as a full-length feature , it ran out of gas shortly after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at what is really troubling about pop culture . it certainly can't be because the theaters still make popcorn in cocoanut oil and people who go to theaters in the mall talk during the film . demented rants that he is quite willing to die for art and will do anything to make his film . -- to her enthusiasm about changing her image and acting in their film , made for some of the most amusing scenes in the film . the kidnapping scene had some energy in it before even that became tiresome . there was some gentle digs at hollywood : from poking fun at a pauly shore film marathon to the mall showing only " star wars " and " star trek " films to the set of the expensive remake of " forrest gump " being taken over by the guerillas to `les enfants du paradis' panned for being insultingly dubbed in english to mocking the maryland film commission to the " patch adams " film showing of a director's cut in the mall . these were easy targets and the comedy wasn't that funny or radical . it might have been funny on paper but when acted out , it seemed to be mild stuff , things even mainstream films do in a more daring way these days . everyone in the film is bursting at the seams thinking about sex , but cecil has outlawed sex until the movie is completed , so they all live by being sexually frustrated and some are even confused about what kind of sexuality fits them . there's not much to prove by the kidnapping , as the story is really irrelevant . the thing here is if the character can shock you and if the film hit your funny bone . for me , it came up close to empty in all respects . i'll take my deranged films from andy warhol anytime , whose freaks are really freaky and whose stories have more of an edge to them . here , dorff is good enough as the abby hoffman characterization of a punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist , while griffith is a good sport , taking in all the remarks about honey's age , her ego-centredness , her tantrums , her phony public demeanor and her defense of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a hollywood star , first defending and then renouncing it . but i wouldn't call her performance acting , as she was mainly around to play a prop of herself to be used as a source for the comedy . the satire was not tough enough to make this a biting film , but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption to really antagonize anyone but the christian right-wing moralists . and since it can still at least do that , no matter how trivial this film is , i guess , the film has a little fire in its belly . . . by the way , water's stated in an interview that the film got its title " cecil b . demented , " because that's what he was called in an early review . 
the third dull hollywood film about mars in a little over a year , after tim burton's " mars attacks ! " i would think that three strikes and you're out should apply to any more of these space bombs cast into theaters by producers with big budgets and small stories . this one's a nuts-and- bolts sci-fier that looks good but its dialogue is just terrible , with the capable cast unable to overcome the poorly plotted story and saying things like val kilmer is forced to say about mars , " things happen on mars that are extreme and otherworldly . " the characters are either undeveloped or predictable stock characters . south african director anthony hoffman directs without imagination , as the film seems to drag on at a lethargic pace . the " red planet " was also void of humor and the obstacles encountered by the astronauts seemed arbitrarily thrown into the film to purposefully give the film an excuse for the special effects to be the star . i think hollywood should reevaluate its plans to make these special effect only films about mars and see if they can go back to the drawing board and put some life into these stories about the earth's last frontier . those b-movies made in the 1950s on a shoestring budget were more entertaining to me than this large-scale leaden sci-fi adventure story . the other crew members are so boring and one-dimensional , that when they started getting picked off one by one , for one reason or another , i was rooting for a more efficient way of getting rid of them , maybe picking up the pace at two at a time killings . this was some crew , lacking in credibility , wit and likability ! the mars lander descends to the surface with gallagher , burchenal , santen , pettengil and chantilas . we then get into the special effects part of the film , the only thing the film can brag about , as there's a well-photographed crash landing scene . did god do it ? it's an interesting theme , but this film was only able to grab onto its spectacular special effects ( showing the mars earth mysteriously moving ) and by proving that there is life on mars , and was not able to follow through on any ideas invested in the far-reaches of the story . i thought the film lacked suspense , and the acting was only bearable , not giving this film too much of a chance to overcome its overall dullness . if you are the kind of viewer who goes bananas for technology , this film might seem better to you than what i thought of it , as that part of the film was stunning , indeed . but if you are interested in a lively story , then i'm afraid you wouldn't get that on this mission . 
the cinematographer ed emshwiller , once known as emsh , used a hand-held 135-pound sound camera for some scenes , often composing superimpositions in the camera . adolfas has come up with an offbeat , lighthearted romantic/comedy spoof , that gently mocks france's new wave cinema , which was the vogue among intellectuals at the time . this is a film geared to film buffs and indie lovers who are interested in some of the early 1960s works coming out of the underground cinema movement in the states . there is no political message or drug visualizations here , as the film tends to rely on the energy conveyed by the characters and the fun they seemed to be having with this unpredictable material they had to work with . if you're into sight-gags and strange visual images , then you should be pleased with the enthusiastic direction of this film . i enjoyed it as a look back at a more innocent time in cinema and a chance to watch it poke fun at other arty styles of cinema . the comedy part of the film had the feel of those buster keaton silent ones . as an homage to the 'new wave , ' vera is played by a different actress in the courting scenes with jack and leo , which take place during different seasons . i guess they both had different impressions of her , so it does make sense that they see her differently , therefore why not have a different actress play her for each . the bizarre visuals gave this film its slapstick look , as there was one scene of the boys dancing a hebrew dance by a campfire in the woods , in another chinese subtitles appear to the side of a landscape scene , in another the boys frolic in a frozen lake , in one scene there are people instead of birds on the branches of a tree . it was goofy fun . 
a poignant melodrama about the side effects of battle-fatigue lingering after ww11 . it is a finely acted and well produced film , but the story itself is not that involving . i found its build-up to the climax , where secrets would be bared about how meeker got to be the way he was , not worth the wait in finding out . what the film did well was show that after the war many americans thirsted for a better standard of life and thought they could get it in the suburbs . meeker was particularly effective in being a sympathetic figure , craving for affection and love , in this low-key human interest story . 
a film advertised as an exploitive film about steamy sex that fails to deliver that part of the bargain , but delivers an expose on white slavery practices in new york city at the turn of the century . the shots of ellis island are interesting from an historical prospective rather than in the primitive way they were shot by the movie . it is worth seeing the film for an authentic look at how the city looked , but should be especially interesting for cinefiles to see how film has developed a long way from then and to film buffs who are interested in seeing a film that is rarely shown . this is the same theme westerns used for decades in their b-films . though the film was contrived and certainly couldn't hold-up to modern scrutiny of what we might think a good film should be like , it was nevertheless a milestone in film , paving the way for the kind of films hollywood would soon become noted for making . in my opinion , they should have chosen to make artistic films like von stroheim's silent classic 'greed' ( 25 ) , instead of taking this more exploitive and superficial path . but that doesn't prevent this film from being an interesting watch . 
also , the locations are gorgeous ( actual location shots are in ecuador's quito wilderness ) and the escapist story about kidnap-and-ransom has enough of a tinge of realism to catch one's interest . . . but all that is still not enough to stop the thinly plotted story from dragging in spots , bringing on a dullness to its critical life-and-death situations , and falling into clich ? territory from the get-go , as the film failed to be anything but trite -- a film that tried desperately to have a heart , but all it has to show for its effort is that it looks like a typical hollywood action film , something tried and marketed many times before . a good film to rest your brain cells and get carried away by the star's screen presence . and , if you do not judge the film on a more critical standard , i think you'll get your money's worth , that is , if you're in the market for seeing a beautiful looking escapist film . that flat rambo-like chopper rescue is a rehearsal for the expected rescue that will set the scene for the film's payoff , showing us beforehand what terry is capable of doing . it made for dull film fare , even though it smacked of some semblance of truth . this film just got butchered because it was unable to be imaginative and make its exciting plot line come alive . it just stalls and falls into a rather trite escapade into the jungles to rescue an american engineer from revolutionaries who are caricatured as being stupid , cruel , lazy , and high on drugs . their romance was forgettable , leaving me feeling too distant from the lovers and their flirtatious romance . it certainly didn't have the impact of the romantic parting in " casablanca , " an ending this film tried to emulate . the film just didn't have too much juice in its hackneyed story , or in its generalized characterization of revolutionaries , oil moguls , and heroes . 
adjectives such as vacuous and pretentious fit this film to a tee . it was unable to get theater bookings , even with the star-studded cast and paul schrader's prestigious name listed as the screenwriter and director , and even though it played at the toronto and telluride film festivals . the script was pale , leading nowhere but down a dark path of murky noir morality . by the time we get to the payoff scene , the film seemed meaningless . the movie is a mess . . . with sappy dialogue fit more for a film like erich segal's " love story . " this one layed an egg with the whiny and pleading joseph fiennes character reduced to saying mostly corny love lines to the boring gretchen mol character for most of the film . it is a film that believes love can be pure , that it can overcome all sorts of corruption in the world . it is a film that believes certain people are made for each other and will overcome any obstacle to be together . that idea might have sounded good on paper , but when shot on film , the steamy love story turns out to be dull , mainly because fiennes and mol didn't seem to connect , there was hardly any electricity between the two when in each other's arms . ray liotta's corrupt world of politics and business , seemed too generalized a characterization to give spice to the story . schrader seemed to be trying to make some obscure political point by comparing the watergate year of 1973 when the film begins -- with the even more corrupt reagan contra involvement in 1987 -- when the film ends . so much for the pure love the story tried to convey ! 
a meant to be chic sci-fi film , set in an ohio high school , that pays homage to a number of other trashy genre horror films , but especially to horror classics such as " invasion of the body snatchers " and " the thing " and more surprisingly to " the breakfast club , " as in the film's best moments , it explores teen relationships and the pressure put on teens to succeeed by parents and from peer pressure to conform with the group . the fast-paced story , the crisp editing , and the atmospheric music plus all the schlock horror it could throw out to the audience by using those traditional podlike aliens , helped make this a silly venture geared mainly for the under 25 crowd ( i'm not only referring to age , but to i . q . ) . robert rodriguez ( " el mariachi " / " desperado " ) , the director , and kevin williamson ( " scream " ) , the screenwriter , have created a film that lacks suspense , lacks freshness , lacks wit , and suffers from some rather lame special effects . if there is enjoyment to be found , it's in the frantic moments when the students are acting out their stereotypes and some of the vilest things come up out of their wiser-than-they-should-be mouths . it's a cult film for those with a taste for earwigs , a stomach for slop , and an appetite for mind altering drugs . . . gee ! i wonder why i wasn't more taken with the film ! 
a mystery thriller from the pen of daphne du maurier , tepidly adapted to the screen from gore vidal's murky script in a workman-like way by robert hamer . it's a one-idea film and that idea is unable to dispel all the holes in the blurry plot , even though it is well-acted . it is a dual role he plays admirably , but he does not leave any lasting impression in either part . the surprise ending was predictable and did not help salvage this rather dry film . the film's main fault was that it failed to maintain a level of tension for its mystery story , and the three weeks that barratt played at being a french nobleman was hardly believable . this is a good story as written for a book , but it was not filmed with any verve . the middle part of it seemed to be going nowhere and by the time the payoff came , the confrontation between the morally concerned barratt and the villainous count , seemed too artificial and lifeless for me to give its supposedly shocking outcome a second thought . 
after all , it's still " home , sweet home . " the old-fashioned values displayed give the film a dated look , and all the manipulative situations prevent this film from being viewed as anything but a star vehicle , which should be pleasing for pickford fans . she's a real charmer , with a good cinema presence . the film had a few heartwarming moments : mom dancing an irish jig , terry taking his date pickford home and then -- climbing up the rickety steps of the tenement and looking chagrined as he was thwarted from kissing her as she toyed with him , and there was also the playful mood displayed by pickford with all the men in her life , not a bit envious of her so-called betters , proud of the inner character she has . . . even the film should be of special interest to mary pickford fans and to those who want to see why she was considered " america's sweetheart . " 
his auteur signature is to create shocking scenes and characters who will try to freak the audience out . this in-your-face film is about attitude . i can't say that i enjoyed it , or found it interesting , but i can say that i found it different . . . and , it didn't box me in as to how i was to view the characters , letting me make up my own mind as to how i wanted to feel about them . yet korine didn't seem to trust all this poetry he was spreading about and needs to end the film in a conventional way , with a dramatic scene regarding the pregnancy of chloe sevigny . korine shot it on digital video and transferred it to film according to the rules of dogma 95 . the film is an anti-narrative and linear work . he is prone to babbling , drooling , and acting outrageous in a harmless way . a host of characters infiltrate the film for some quick laughs , but , as odd as they were , they seemed like the type of people the family members would be acquainted with , so the scenes with them didn't appear to be as much a freak show as it was a way to make the film entertaining . but the problem was , they didn't go with the flow of the film , as their eccentric behavior seemed forced . in the film's most dramatic moment , towards the end of the movie , pearl trips while at an ice rink and has a miscarriage . i appreciate the effort for originality attempted here , especially with the abundance of formula mainstream and indie films pushed at the public , but i would like to see something more intellectually demanding than just a rant against conventional filmmaking . the filmmaking skills are there , but as of yet , i don't see the 25-year-old director moving too far from the childish shock scenes he threw at the audience for his first film . i'm sure the director meant well by this characterization and that is not where i have difficulty with this film , my difficulty is that the novelty of hearing the incomprehensible chatter of julien soon wore off and the film seemed to grow vacuous and became more a technical film addressing how korine can fool those dogma 95 people by putting in shots with artificial light , which he did numerous times , by breaking the rules he promised to fulfill when getting his dogma 95 certificate , then it was a film about ideas . i would much rather he had made a more substantial film rather than making another anti-intellectual indie film , mainly showing off his superior knowledge of digital video techniques . . . but offering no real insights into the mentally unbalanced characters deeper than what is seen on the surface . there is still too much skateboarder braggadocio in him and not enough filmmaker . . . but the future holds a lot of promise for this talented filmmaker . 
a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown . this surreal thriller amounts to a beautifully photographed and stylish film . there is no rational payoff to explain what is happening except this is some pretty sick stuff we are seeing . it's a vile film , that tries to take the film down the same road as coppola's " the conversation " and where a number of other morally blurred films about voyeurism had gone , aiming mostly , perhaps , along the lines of brian de palma's suspenseful works . it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film . lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen . since nothing in this film made sense , why should one expect her role to ! so the film ends as clumsily and distantly as it was throughout . as all we get from this film are some cheap exploitive thrills and a tease that there is some intellectual message hidden in all the mental gymnastics , but what we really have , is a film that failed to get untracked . 
a made for tv movie that looks and feels like a made for tv movie ( it was stale ) . since i wasn't held in suspense , i instead turned my attention on guessing who did it , using my conditioned experiences from watching such tv shows , therefore i knew it wouldn't be the most obvious one . i did guess who it was about half way through on a hunch , since the plot didn't leave much in clues . i hate to be a killjoy , but that , unfortunately , was the only enjoyment i got out of the film . set in a city hospital , the film pays homage to soap operas like general hospital , as in numerous scenes a patient is seen watching the unnamed soap opera , as is the bartender where the doctors hangout , rosie ( ann wedgeworth ) . it made for a forgettable film , one that was probably intended as a pilot for a possible tv series . the b-film left a warm spot in my heart , as it cured my insomnia without me using a sleeping pill and having to worry about side effects . 
an off-beat , haunting , overwrought fairy tale for adults . this visually pleasing allegory ends on an apocalyptic note . it takes a stab at being an intelligent slasher movie for those who like their gore laced with some sensible dialogue to go along with its good and evil characterizations . the surreal forest sets the dark mood for philip ridley's eerie and atmospheric film . what propels this film is not the slight story , but the bold interactions among the characters and the striking symbolic conflict over strict biblical interpretations versus a worldly sensual view of life . but the film just couldn't wait to get to the slasher part fast enough , and that left very little time in the film's middle to go into the brainy part of the movie , leaving the film literally and figuratively going up in smoke by the finale . 
a modern day western adapted from cormac mccarthy's national book award-winning novel of 1992 , which was accurately transferred to film by ted tally's script , as it kept the same laconic cowboy dialogue from the book intact , but was reduced considerably from the over three hour length director billy bob thornton originally shot it in , to under two hours , the length the people from miramax wanted it . it was hard to tell if the film was missing anything because of this deletion , but i did find the film to be directed with a skewed sense of rhythm . there were also too many scenes that failed to go anywhere , making the film dull at times . for a slow moving film , there was the contradiction of scenes happening too fast to be developed and fully realized . as a result , " all the pretty horses " failed to be engaging . if the filmmaker was aiming for an epic , he sure didn't get it in this sometimes elegaic film . what he got is something that plays more like a slick magazine photo shoot on the travails of being a cowboy , or as a touristy travelogue of what the old west was like , or as a stylish film that can't find what it wants to say and stumbles around in the grimness of a prosaic story about youthful aspirations . what it lacked was some emotional kick , as the scenes where the cowboys show off their spirited exuberance , seemed more portentous than not and just didn't jive with the unsure pace of the film . what caught my attention in a positive way was how pretty the picturesque vistas were and how the film gave off some good cowboy vibes about friendship and loyalty and had some good cowboy lingo to go along with all the pretty horses and with the hot-blooded senorita played by pen ? lope cruz . it becomes an on-the-trail film , with a love story and a revenge story filling in the life of the youthful cowboy drifters , as everything in the film gets boiled down to a simplicity that is too simple-minded to just accept without asking questions . " how i was is how i am , and all i know is to stick . " now that's some wicked cowboy talk 'pardner ! ' i found him to be the most interesting one in the film , as he adds his childish stubborness , volatility , homespun humor , tough backbone for fair play , silly superstitions about thunder and brings with him the hard-luck of someone who never had a chance in this world , giving this complacent film , seemingly so self-satisfied with its boring self , a chance to become energized by his maverick portrayal . when blevens is onscreen , the shallowness of the story doesn't seem to matter , because his coming-of-age story is better than john grady's . i'm not believing what i can't see . there might have been a good picture in this tale , but it just never kicked in . everything about the film felt choppy and not certain of the direction it was going in . the star-crossed lovers had no depth or sense of urgency in their lustful romance , and the film spent so much time trying to tie up all the loose-ends about the romance , and yet it had nothing much to say about it , as it always seemed hollow . though the buddy story was well-played between damon and thomas , as damon showed that he could be expressive and wear his changing feelings in a credible way . his problem was , even though he could physically do the cowboy role , i was never convinced that he actually was one . but the most disheartening thing about this film , was how out of whack it seemed , as the story had no staying power , it kept going off the trail , until it looked more like a marlboro billboard commercial than an enriching story of two decent young men living out their dream to be cowboys . something must have gotten lost in adapting the book to film , because i couldn't find where the heartfelt story was in all the superficiality i was surrounded by . the real star of this film was the landscape , i couldn't take my eyes off it . i think pen ? lope cruz can act ( at least she can in an almodovar film ) , but in this film she's around only as part of the beautiful scenery . i know matt damon can act and he shows in this film that he can let us look inside him , but i don't think he was up to being the romantic lead needed to make this film come alive . overall the film lacked a psychological breath to get us more involved in the characters . after seeing that , i didn't know whether to laugh or cry . 
a casual , inane throwaway film , directed by peter howitt , of " sliding door " infamy , without aplomb and best viewed as being a film about a geek getting a dream job that turns out to be nightmare . a film geared for those who can't get enough of geek angst , pc's , and cappuccino into their system , and therefore need unrealistic thrillers about geek lifestyles to inspire them with more highs from cyberspace . while , for others , they can relish in the film's anti-microsoft feelings . gary takes that gates persona on and runs with it into murderous territory , where even gates' harshest critics haven't gone in their description of him . you're a one or a zero . a tour of nurv's ultra-modern geek headquarters , which is a campus with multi-buildings and satellites on it , fills us in on the atmosphere around such high-tech complexes . the film enters the world of make-believe and has the same empty feeling to it as a bond film . speak about perfect casting , then you must speak about tim robbins . he's really fun to watch in his understated but brilliant performance as the sociopath billionaire , a clone of bill gates . he even looks like gates . ryan phillippe is energetic and believable as the curly-haired nerd , who can't say no to capitalism , even if he can't say yes to it . the film is modestly entertaining . it is certainly diverting . it is also senseless and unimportant . it's a hollywood film , a nostalgia film about the heyday of internet startups in the 1990s and of the powerful global influence of the microsoft empire it emulates and the many geeks it drew into its sticky web and through stock-options made some millionaires and some billionaires . a film for those who are into 'virtual unreality . ' there is no message in this improbable tale that isn't garbled . the filmmaker had a chance to say something , but prefers to play it safe and come up with a possible blockbuster out of a film rife with mindless action sequences . i could see an audience for this film consisting of cyberspace junkies willing to see anything about computers . it is an absurd film that was one mouse click away from crashing . 
offbeat film director alan rudolph ( chooseme ) makes films that require an acquired taste to fully enjoy . in this fluff piece , which the director calls a " screwball noir , " it suffers mostly because its mixture of being a formula noir tale and a comic farce is overtaken by its forced comedy and a story that has little drama in it , but it perks up at times because of the charming performances by all concerned and the constant barrage of wacky dialogue . the film starts off in an amusingly pleasant way , as trixie's banter is laced with continuous malapropisms such as , 'by hook or ladder , ' 'he smokes like a fish , ' and 'nobody is human . ' the film's strongest scene is set on red's boat , where violence and a possible sense of an orgy happening clouds the pleasure cruise . unfortunately , the picture itself also unravels . this is an actor's picture , where they are given every chance to do their thing , even if it results in over-acting . the film was mildly enjoyable , but could have been much better if rudolph tried to put a coherent story together instead of just going for cheap comedy . 
the wedding planner is a romantic comedy cut from the cloth of the hollywood studio zany comedies of the '50s . it reminded me most of " the father of the bride , " only it didn't have spencer tracy's assurances that everything would turn out ok , as the film looked real good for the first 70 minutes and then slid into tedium and then into a contrived ending ala " the graduate . " massimo is a manipulative clod , with a penchant for saying and doing the wrong thing , and is someone she never liked , even though he's not bad looking . upon the introduction of massimo into the story , the film loses its energy . but there should be no surprise how everything is resolved . it's a modestly successful romantic comedy , much like those old-fashioned fluff films of yesterday . it's ready made for an audience that applauds when two people who are meant for each other , wind up with each other no matter what . hollywood loves churning out stories like that because they're good box office and have mass appeal . this is one of those films , and if that's your poison , be my guest , you won't be disappointed by this one . the film's big joke is when jennifer is told she has a big neck , an obvious reference to jay leno's running gag about her big derri ? re . 
a sometimes engaging indie film about three best friends growing up in nyc , that is a heartfelt story but is hampered by its awkward dialogue and unfulfilling plot . all these characters seemed contrived and left the film feeling flat , though comedy burst forth from time to time . the best conversations are between danny and stan , and give the pic its intellectual stimulus and reason for being . " went to coney island " never got untracked , though it had some bright dramatic moments and some perceptive comic offerings , but it could never come together as a complete picture . it was also done in by a needless subplot of stan getting into gambling debts and being beaten , which just seemed like padding to a thin story . too much of the film seemed to have no place to go , just like misinformed tourists who go to coney in the winter to see the idle cyclone ride . 
a poor imitation of lubitsch's classic romance/comedy trouble in paradise . even though it is terribly outdated for modern audiences , it was seen as the height of fashion at its time as for style and dress . it was a witty depression eye-pleaser for american audiences who liked to watch the rich in action , especially seeing them get robbed of their jewels . 
there's something whimsical to be said about universal-international's most strained sci-fi film of the 1950s , it sunk to new lows to get to its subject matter . in this heavy-handed message film , the main theme depicts how intolerant people could be who hide behind their religious beliefs blindly and continue to keep others ignorant of the truth . the adventure was clumsily made and was too pedantic to be good cinema . the acting was stiff and the special effects were cheesy . but somehow there was fun to be had in all this under the earth nonsense . 
something that is more real than the computer games he is hooked on . the film can't seem to be told without the voiceover from leonardo dicaprio , explaining his thought process and what's going on . he seemed like a much nicer bloke than richard . . . but such is life ! the beach is the real star of the film , as the cinematography of it is scintillating . the film itself wasn't a bad film , as much as it was an empty one . there is just very little to digest here . the slight story is a predictable one , as the drug-dealing farmers mean business , so when richard's four unwanted acquaintances arrive , we know what response to expect from the farmers . it made for some beautiful fantasy shots via computer graphics , but added nothing to the film's story . the film concludes as a lesson that there is no such thing as a paradise on earth , and if there were , it wouldn't remain one for long because man's desires are far-reaching . so it's back to virtual reality for the dicaprio character , after all , the theme of the film seems to imply , maybe that's not so bad a thing to be doing with your life . in an interview he gave for cable tv , he said he didn't mind that this hollywood film took some liberties with his story to juice it up sexually so we can see leonardo romance the beautiful virginie ledoyen and have another affair with tilda swinton , additions that were not part of the novel . the photography of that underwater kiss with ledoyen was sensational , as they were lit up like christmas trees from the opalescent plant life that surrounded them . the romance itself had no sparkles in it . overrated director , danny boyle ( " a life less ordinary " / " trainspotting " / " shallow grave " ) , is skilled at working his magic on films that are basically insubstantial by relying on non-narrative things to do the job , such as the energy from the actors and the beauty in his visual sets . here , he is aided by the wonderfully gifted cinematographer , darius khondji , who makes the beach look like a cross between the figment of one's psychedelic dream and an ongoing computer game , something you can't take your eyes off . it was just too bad that the story didn't have more weight to it , or should i say some weight to it , because this film played mostly like a travelogue . don't blame the actors for what went wrong here , they did their job the best they could . the fault is all in the script . 
a sci-fi film , originally started as a student project , noted only for its great special effects , as created by dennis muren . muren now does the special effects for george lucas on his star war films and won an oscar for his work . this film is a good example of his first effort doing special effects in a feature film . the problem with this film -- that came 30 years before blair witch project and has its same scary themes played out in the woods by students -- is its amateur acting , shoddy production values , horrible script , and ridiculous story . the acting is so flat and awkward , that the film never seemed professional , even though it was reworked for theatrical release . it could be appreciated by some horror film buffs despite all its shortcomings and genre clich ? s for its crudeness . there are just some people who love bad films . the film is one long flashback of dave's recollections , as he seems to be also recollecting things he wasn't even involved with . don't ask me how he can do that ! jim , in between bites on his picnic chicken , says this is pretty heavy stuff . hey , jim ! the remainder of the film is a testimony to the special effects created on such a limited budget , but the story can only be constued as ridiculous , as the four young students who must have taken stupid pills to still be hanging around in the woods , continue on with their adventure . asmodeus will show his true face to jim and make him an offer for the book , offering to conjure up anything in the world he wants for it , which sounds like a fair trade , if you ask me . 
a mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it presents andy warhol's dictum that , in the future , everybody will be famous for 15 minutes , and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving around how everyone is enchanted by fame , either wanting to be a celebrity or to gawk at them . it also presents an annoyingly didactic message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the rules , as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale . there is nothing subtle about this heavy-handed thriller . the good part of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention grabbing psychopathic villain ( karel roden ) challenging the self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective ( de niro ) , which makes for vulgar entertainment . it's a film that has about 15 minutes of fervor to it before it gets grounded into a mixture of sleaze , violence , and heartless melodrama . emil will at one point declare : " i love america ! the only good thing about this arrangement , is that despite its seamly nature , eddie is a dedicated and good cop , and the show does help in catching criminals . other than the action scenes brilliantly filmed by jean yves escoffier , the movie is unappealing . as for the actors : de niro is playing a part he always does very well , showing off his comical gift for quirkiness and endowing his character with a larger than life presentation . burns is his opposite , a bland personality , who doesn't watch tv or seek publicity , and the performance succeeds only in being a bland one , intentional or not . the juiciest part is reserved for roden , who makes the most out of being a scary figure , a sociopath with an unintentionally droll wit . he could be any one of a number of tabloid tv slimy hosts , reminding me most of the ass kissing geraldo rivera . there's not much to this flick , except for the beautiful way its mayhem was filmed . its cynical opinion of the media seemed hypocritical , since this film is just as exploitive and violent as the tabloid tv show it was railing against for the whole two hours of this film . 
it features style over substance and is less worried about storytelling than in looking odd and being confusingly mod . the film leaves too many loose ends as to what the heck is going on for it be clearly understood . it can best be enjoyed for its visual beauty , especially , in its smoky gothic images of the manhattan skyline and the luxury residence of the antiheroes . to understand what's really happening requires reading whitley streiber's novel , from which the film is based . since this info is only clear by reading the book , this film makes a gross error in its filmmaking decisions by not letting these details out of the bag in its storytelling . this was the best scene in the film , as dick smith's makeup for the aging bowie was terrific . the hunger left me craving for a more filling movie . in the hands of a better director , this cult film could have been a real tasty treat . 
a visually pleasing but unmoving homage biopic of the 18th-century spanish painter francisco goya . the director , carlos saura , has had trouble with the storytelling part of his films in the past , as his great craftsmanship skills seem to far exceed his other abilities as a filmmaker . the film opens in a surreal manner as a cow's carcass seems to be dragging itself over a dirt red field to a scaffold and then raises itself up as its flesh opens and its insides are exposed . it was goya's belief that man without imagination is only an animal , and this is the first lesson we are taught in this pedantic film study of him . the film never touched base with the painter and his great works of art . it seemed like a dry lecture , with the artist's paintings laboriously put on display , making for some gorgeous framed shots , but not offering a film that is emotionally touching . what we learn is that goya was a flawed man , feeling himself to be cowardly and weak-spirited at times , whose great influences to overcome his shortcomings were , vel ? zquez , rembrandt , and his imagination tied to reason . but the film itself does not let on why we should assume goya was a great painter , it seems to have failed the artist in that sense . i was left with the impression that if this film would continue in its pedantic way of telling the story , it is possible in part 2 that we would know why that was so . 
my darling ! ) for a hammer film , this one is as good it gets for them . it's a bizarre psychological story with lots of hitchcock's psycho in it . it's a disturbing film about a hostage situation involving an insane religious fanatic . tallulah bankhead plays the bible quoting nut mrs . trefoile , in an over-the top performance that is frightening to behold . as crazy as the tale was , it all seemed possible . 
a shlock frankenstein flick by strock . this ones strictly for the drive-in crowd of the 1950s . to see it in the next century , is to watch how a bad film could still be around because it has attained cult-film status . everything is there but the face . there's a discreet housekeeper who is hardly seen , except when she serves him meals . this upsets doc so much that he cuffs her . getting no response , doc says " answer me ! you have a civil tongue in your head ! i know , i sewed it in there ! " the monster turns out to be a bit cranky and is not completely obedient to his master . the film's violent climax for some reason switches out of it b&w format and goes into technicolor . this is a lovable bad film , but don't ask me why ! 
this is an obscure bela lugosi film and it's not bad . bela's the bad guy with a foreign accent . his fans will love him here , as this film has been restored recently and is now watchable . 
it's good in parts , but it fails to deliver in its unbelievable surprise ending . 
an enigmatic thriller that never quite gets going . it's always too enigmatic and bleak , and its surprise ending falls like a dead weight into a waterfalls . it's a film that successfully and darkly explores the motives of its three female characters and their ambiguous relationships with others . 
this is a swiss cheese psycho genre film . there are just too many holes in the plotline of this hollow thriller for it to be convincing . the film is most successful in hiding its plot twists and its surprise ending but , in going for that and that alone , the film lost track of how unbelievable the story was becoming and how shallow all the characters were , except for the morgan freeman character . morgan freeman played the same role in the 1997's kiss the girls , and that mediocre film brought in lots of dough ( $60 million ) . so the producers must have thought , why not try and cash in on another mediocre thriller ! unfortunately , freeman can't carry this film on his back , though he almost does . he's so good an actor that he's usually better than the script he's given , as is the case here . the fun in this film might be in making a list of all the holes in the story , and whoever comes up with the first hundred wins a prize . once you get the error list rolling , you'll see how ludicrous this film is . i quickly counted thirty such flubs before i got weary and decided to give up my count . 
the gauche wardrobe and fancy haircuts are part of the flashy drug scene and the film's attempt to capture the real look of the druggie scene . his hedonistic journey through the marijuana years of the 1960s and 1970s and the disco cocaine years of the 1980s and 1990s , is a sad reminder of the way the pop culture scene had its darker side . the highs from " blow " come mostly from the colorful fashion show it parades before us and depp's brilliantly nuanced performance , as he shows off his inscrutability and his swagger , where he challenges us to be sympathetic to him even if he's a lowlife drug dealer and an uninteresting character , whose selfish dream is all about himself accumulating money and material happiness . there was not much else to get off on , as " blow " didn't have the script or the kind of direction needed to blow one away . the movie plays it real safe , as the only users the audience sees are the flashy hollywood types that no one cares about . " blow " suffered because it was too simplistic in its storytelling , in its nonjudgmental stance on drugs , and in shamelessly pulling the audience to the side of the nice guy drug dealer , george jung . it doesn't even have the will of another recent drug trafficking film , " traffic , " to even spend a moment worrying about the consequences of hard drugs . but the biggest bust about " blow , " is that it's just not a good film to get off on . if cocaine was not the subject matter , this film would be boring ( and it probably wouldn't have been made ) . george failed to be a worthwhile character for us to care about him . this film is just another blip in a long line of unimportant drug related films . really . . . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it doesn't preach to us . 
a fast-paced film noir about corruption and double-crosses , that has a lot of plot twists and a nifty surprise ending . the film was cheaply made and the acting didn't distinguish itself . but the story had a lot of snap to it . it's not a bad watch , but lovers of film noir should like it more than others . 
a fair remake of the 1930 and 1920 versions of this film . a very conventional film . 
a routine mystery story with a misleading title . this low budget film is watchable , but do not expect anything more than that . 
legendary schlockmeister ed wood cited for winning the golden turkey award for worst director of all time and for bad films such as glen or glenda , bride of the monster , and plan 9 from outer space , and for being an inspiration to all bad directors , tries desperately to make a film noir out of jail bait . the film is so poorly acted , the script is so ludicrous , the settings are so tacky but , unfortunately , for woods , the plot and the narration tell a complete and understandable story ( something not done in wood films ) . this is wood's attempt to be taken seriously , and he makes this the best film he has ever made . unfortunately , this film is not as prone to unintended laughs as his others and therefore fails to live up to what the director has built his reputation on . " jail bait " is a misleading title for the film , as it is a phrase that usually refers to underaged women . he completes the surgery and utters out loud " that plastic surgery at times seems to me to be very very complicated . " 
an old-fashioned love story that is more vague than uplifting . it plays more like an art-house film than as a realistic drama . the woman character immerses herself in raw nature as a means of reinvigorating her energy and escaping from her dull life . she's impressed by mart ? n's quiet demeanor and frankness , and his rugged good looks . the camera does a beautiful job of catching the raw countryside of hidden valley in long sweeping shots of its splendid mountain ranges and its raw terrain , and its magnificent forest . what happens next is too murky and not convincingly established to be totally believable , as things moved too fast without the viewer seeing what was happening ; not enough is ever revealed for us to comprehend what is behind her sudden conflict , except for her husband's lies and her fatal attraction for his brother . the film had a sad mood throughout and this was reinforced by mart ? n bauer's musical score for classic argentinean guitar and cello , which played in the background throughout the film . there even seems to be a hint that mart ? n is too gentle a person and could not have possibly committed murder , except nothing is ever settled for sure . even the moving performance by paola krum cannot uncover what the film is lacking . it remains too obscure , locked up too tightly in paola krum's mind . 
a complex contemporary horror flick based on a novel by whitley strieber , that is slow in developing and when it becomes evident what's happening there's more interest intellectually in what is uncovered than thrills . there's much self-indulgent ecology to chew on , in this slickly filmed surrealistic presentation . but i found the film to be on the dull side ( except for the camera work ) . outstanding british cinematographer gerry fisher does the honors of making this a very stylish looking film , which gives the impression that something deeper than what appears to be happening is taking place . all the camera shots are presented in this manner , showing how the wolves can pick up man's scent much quicker than he can theirs and their heat-seeking vision can detect their quarry's body temperature . they cannot be vanquished ; so i guess the message is , that we better learn how to live with the werewolf , they will always be with us . hey , i'm willing to give it shot . . . as i think finney is , also . 
an action-packed high-tech thriller , whose best virtues are that it doesn't take itself seriously and there's plenty of action . if you forget a little thing like the story doesn't make sense and the theater you are in supplies you with bon-bons , then there's a chance you might be lulled into accepting this flashy summertime film at face value and be pleased by it . the film has a snappy " pulp fiction " like start to it , as a puffy john travolta stares into the camera and his first words are : " you know what the problem with hollywood is - they make shit . " the film loses its wit and becomes a mindless thriller from here on , as director dominic sena ( gone in sixty seconds ) , a parolee himself from schlockmeister producer jerry bruckheimer , tries to push the envelope in favor of evil doings and away from making a pg-13 film . he succeeds in making an amoral film , where none of the characters are all good or bad ( or for that matter interesting ) . he leaves us with such an awful feeling , pretty much like this filmmaker left us with in " gone in sixty seconds . " this turns out to be another preposterous flick of his , but with the trappings that it has something more to say about the evil in the world than all the violence it pours onto the screen . the film has lots of expensive gadgets to work with , and they are used as explosives and as gimmicks to fill in for the words that stop making sense after a while . there are the usual betrayals and twists in such a story , the maddening conclusion to the hostage situation , and a dubious ending that is slickly done . with such a dark delineation of morals exhibited by all sides , who cares who wins ! this film is about exploding all the toys the big-budget allowed for and keeping the action frenetic and the sex as tawdry as possible . the acting was dreary . hugh jackman's performance was particularly rancid . john travolta thinks he's houdini , but he seems more like a guy getting good money for playing a part that required little acting skills other than to just look sinister and smile occasionally . this " swordfish " has a smell to it , like it's not fresh . but if you're looking for crass summertime entertainment , this dish of " swordfish " can please those who have a very tolerant palate . 
a bittersweet romantic comedy , french style . the one thing this film has going for it , is nathalie baye in the starring role . this became a very popular french film winning france's c ? sar awards for best picture , best director , best young actress and best screenplay . as is the custom in a french film of this kind , love is the most important thing in the world . at first , we don't know what to make of antoine , whether he's a psycho or just a drifter , as his straggly appearance is not appealing to ang ? le . he tells her : " i can't stop thinking of you -- i love you so much . " it's a sexy french romp into familiar territory , with characters who don't tell us much about what's inside them . is able to remain pleasantly atmospheric until the nonsensical melodramatic climax , when its charmed life runs out of charm . there's nothing new uncovered about relationships here , in fact the main relationship is more absurd than real . but nathalie baye is able to carry off this fantasy romance story further than it deserved to go , and for that alone it's worth a look . 
a slickly done , very depressive melodrama about those addicted to drugs and their dreams of happiness . it's a film that has excellent performances , especially , the brilliant one by ellen burstyn , as the pill popping old lady who morbidly changes her appearance for the worst after taking diet pills . aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives . it's not an easy film to find comfort in , or feel anything but revulsion at the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place . it's also not an easy film to enjoy or to find any insights it has about drug addictions that are fresh . the best scenes in the film were when either harry or sara were reaching out to the other to send out messages of hope . by the film's end , not much substance came through all the stylishly and graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent ; what i mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see any more of their hellish experiences . it's a movie where the first half of it was clearly more subtle and better done than the more morbid and predictable second half . i can applaud the director for his visual style of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the screen in a realistic way , but the story of four losers who can't get out of brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss attached to it . 
a spaghetti western that can't be ruined by poor dubbing , an outlandishly gross tale , dialogue that is meaningless , acting that's the pits , a body count for enemies that would satisfy the pentagon during the entire vietnam war , an acrobat who annoyingly can't stop doing flips , an obnoxious strolling banjo player with a rifle hidden in its neck , a drunk knife-thrower , one-dimensional villains , and an assortment of nonsensical gun duels . this film is so bad , so lacking in humor and romance , or any possible relation to reality , yet it is still mindlessly entertaining . there's a lot of spaghetti tossed about in this conventional hollywood looking plot but , nevertheless , typical italian action western . it's not for all tastes , even those who like westerns might not care for the amoral personification of the lee van cleef character . but you can't beat this film for continuous gunfights and mounting body counts . this is the first of a trilogy about sabata . 
a disturbing drama , inspired by a true story , that rails against the hypocritical sexual attitudes of the times . the first-time filmmaker , philip goodhew , takes us behind the nice lace curtains of a respectable british household and brings us a story of repression , jealousy , and obsession . it's a well-made but grimly unmoving film , that dwells on an unpleasant subject , that culminates in a gruesome double homicide . in this rather peculiar m ? nage ? trois , harold is not only stuck with mum but has to ward off joyce . it's my birthday ! " by the climax , it becomes apparent that this affair is no laughing matter . but the film somehow couldn't get past its laughter at these absurd characters and it failed to provide some pathos to go with the dramatics . there was just a growing emptiness that seemed to hang over it , which prevented me from seeing this as just your typical bizarre crime story . 
it's not possible to write this review without revealing the key problematic elements of the film , though i believe these spoilers will not ruin the viewing of this film ; yet , some might prefer to read the review after seeing the film . this makes for a grim drama that is intelligently directed by actor tim roth , in his first directorial effort , as adapted from the novel by alexander stuart , who also did the screenplay ; the performances as well as the photography of the haunting countryside are first-rate , but nothing particularly insightful materializes about this sexually abusive situation . somehow after all the grimness of this story plays out and we see all the graphic details , the story still doesn't grab us emotionally as much as we wanted it to . the tension slowly builds in a household that appears outwardly as a loving one , until it reaches its expected boiling point . this doesn't leave the audience much room to do anything but gasp at the shameful situation presented and the dirty little secret that too many families find themselves in and can't deal with . 
this is the first film to go from a super-16 original to hdtv and then to a 35mm negative . it was shown at the 1998 toronto film festival . jay anania's second feature is a very cold , intellectual film that asks the question : can we have a memory of what we only imagined ? this is a mystery puzzler without much emotional impact or much of a payoff . it's imitative in its minimalist style of a robert bresson film . it was intent on saying something , but you would have to be a mind reader to know what it wanted to say . though , she still is not certain if what she envisions is a dream or a memory . to go along with the somber and ridiculously serious tone of the movie , there are moody vocals by judy kuhn . the film's cinematic style is eye-catching and seems to be what the film was all about , but the acting and the story itself felt forced . 
the emptiness of this film and why its story is so unsatisfying in comparison with its acidy acting and rollicking photography is because english director , jonathan glazer , comes to filmmaking in his debut feature from music videos and television commercials ; he has succeeded only in making a violent film that is ugly below its surface beauty . it's a film that discourages thinking and aggressively forces one to revel in the forceful acting jobs going on by the over-the-edge performance by sociopath ben kingsley , and the understated ones by retired nice guy thief ray winstone and brazen mobster boss ian mcshane . in the end , the performances don't mean much because the story doesn't amount to anything . the film could have used subtitles because the cockney was laid on so thick it was almost incomprehensible to this american's ears . there's nothing special or interesting about the story ; the film is pretty to look at and moves at a rapid pace due to jump-cuts and fast editing , but what happens is inconsequential and the film gets bogged down in its limitations . there were also several surreal dream sequences that gal has , but they seem meaningless and add no weight to the story . as far as the kingsley characterization goes , it was too showy for my taste to keep me riveted to such a pointless story . 
warner oland's final appearance as charlie chan is marred because this is one of the weaker episodes in the long running series . the story was too muddled and not too crisply executed . for comedy , lee's misuse of french leads to some embarrassing situations and joubert's choppy english and inflated pride in his bumbling police department leads to some amusing moments . 
the best thing about the film was falk's tough-guy performance . otherwise , everything was routine . 
the gift is a supernatural thriller whose motto is : 'always follow your instincts . ' unfortunately because of that glitch in the story and the film's gapping holes in logic , i wasn't absorbed by this moody and atmospheric thriller as much as i should have been . when you see how the film will be resolved before the main character does and that person is playing a psychic , then there is something amiss about the story . the suspense always felt tacked on to all the psychic visions that dramatically kept the pot boiling . this ploy always felt contrived and the film never quite felt real . ribisi's portrayal was hammy and particularly uninteresting . the trial was poorly filmed and made a mockery of how a trial should be run . this whodunit had many contrivances and they all sapped strength from the film's already rather weak mystery story . the two things that kept this film watchable were the suspenseful visuals of annie's dark visions -- eerily recalling things from the dead world , and cate's gifted performance , that brought more to the story than the script by billy bob thornton and tom epperson could provide . as a hollywood film it fails to deliver enough punch to be a box-office hit , but as a b-film it seems easier to overlook the film's lack of punch to its story and accept its ordinary gothic story as possibly having more to it than presented . 
a so-so noir melodrama , that can't overcome its limited script and unbelievable premise of a career woman who gives it all up to live a boring life with the husband she's madly in love with . what keeps this melodrama going is the understated star performances generated by raymond burr and sterling hayden , bouncing off the fiercely passionate portrayal stanwyck gives . kathy gets involved in an outlandish situation , in many ways similar but a lot more deadly than those situations she used to make fun of when she wrote her lovelorn column . the best that can be said about this story , is that it's not bad and it had some sparks in it to keep you awake . 
rita hayworth has a bit part as a servant , while stepin fetchit plays his usual stereotyped role--this might be offensive to some . this was a lackluster suspense story , which at times seems more like a horror film ; and , the actors didn't distinguish themselves . but the film gave off some egyptian charm , those borrowed from a long list of hollywood b-movies . 
an uneven production marred by some ethnic slurs against a black butler ( muse ) and by holes in the mystery story , yet had its moments of sheer joy and ends up being a below average entry but can still be enjoyed as your typical charlie chan formula mystery story . this part of the investigation was slapstick comedy and ridiculous . there were also a healthy dosage of slurs against the hindus ; such as , the cops saying : " they all look alike to me . " " how many more ali baba's are there ? " the film was not tightly scripted as the story just didn't make sense , making it not logical to follow who the chief suspects were and what they were up to . also , we never learn why the planes are being sabotaged . too many tacked on explanations still can't clear up all the discrepancies , but that shouldn't really matter to the die-hard fans of the series . 
it was a little hard to find this mystery story credible and the acting was uneven , as many of the supporting characters weren't convincing in their roles . but there's the usual charlie chan formula stuff to keep his fans relatively satisfied with this weaker than average one in the series . 
polar ( director/writer/editor : jacques bral ; screenwriter : from a book by jean-patrick manchette " morgue pleine " /jean-paul leca ; cinematographers : jacques renoir/jean-paul rosa da costa ; editors : anne boissel/noun serra ; cast : jean-fran ? ois balmer ( eugene tarpon ) , sandra montaigu ( charlotte le dantex ) , pierre santini ( inspecteur coccioli ) , roland dubillard ( jean-baptiste haymann ) , claude chabrol ( theadore lyssenko ) , jean-paul bonnaire ( gerard sergent ) , marc dudicourt ( le loup ) , g ? rard loussine ( c ? sar ) , jean-louis foulquier ( alfonsino ) ; runtime : 97 ; les films noris ; 1984-france ) a dark , atmospheric film noir from france , that followed to the letter all the conventions of that genre . it was properly shot in b & w , which gave it that 1940s look . there are a few more surprise plot twists in a story that winds down in a muddled fashion , as the characters and the story are not clearly defined . the film was too much in awe of what film noir is supposed to be like to have much of a breath of its own , but this b-film was entertaining and the two main characters balmer and montaigu had a lot of spunk . this limited film is a good example of an escape film that delivers some mild thrills , but can't overcome becoming a clich ? of the movie it was parodying . 
this revenge film was fast-paced and well-acted , but its story is too far-fetched to be completely convincing . 
a strangely crafted cult-mystery story that is not resolved in a tidy manner , as it asks the viewer to decide if what they saw was the protagonist's hallucination or something real ! it also turns out that there is no such a person as sgt . matthews . the film ends up feeling like a case study for paranoia and madness , more than it does a mystery story . i was absorbed by the story up to a point , but didn't feel satisfied with the vague way the story was resolved . though , david hemmings' convincing performance gives this film a creepy mood to hang its hat on . 
a revolting b film noir , made before director robert wise became known for making classier films . this was his first venture at making a film noir . none of the characters were convincing . the story never seemed credible , as their actions were weird but not explainable . this was a bleak tale , but in a perverse way it was fun to see such a woeful collection of misfits . esther howard added her brand of misogyny to the mix by acting so daffy , and showing some gumption as she spits on trevor . the only thing , this melodrama hardly made any sense . 
that is how the film got its title of " the chase . " it was a fascinating scene , darkly capturing the tortured mind of chuck and the stifling atmosphere of cuba during the mid-forties . this film noir is memorable for its dark , dream-like feel , as reality becomes indistinguishable from the dream sequences . because of those shots , this film became a cult classic ; but , it is one that is rarely shown on tv . they specialize in dark and expressionistic works , which this film is perfect example of . 
a fine example of a 1940s type of film noir , as adapted from a cornell woolrich novel . the acting was commendable and the development of the dark noir world was very well established ; but , the case itself seemed hardly believable-- the dialogue was atrocious , and the crazed , genius killer looking down at his hands and getting dizzy spells was more ridiculous than a truthful presentation . the film had too many defects that just couldn't be overlooked , yet overall it had a mesmerizing effect--largely due to the imaginative direction robert siodmak gave it . 
a monogram cheapie that holds up fairly well as a low-budget b-film noir , featuring robert mitchum in his first starring role . it's directed by the noted schlock thriller director william castle , who lets the story simply unfold and doesn't embellish it with the gimmicks he was later on to employ in his career of making horror exploitation films . they are still really strangers . evidently he's a better salesman than me . " if you don't expect much , you'll be pleased with many of the graceful film noir touches this low-budget film has and the way it created a chilling nyc atmosphere for the story to be played out . it's a minor film , but it does a good job of providing some thrills and has its moments of pure visual delights : like of hunter staring out her hotel window and her face illuminated by a flashing neon sign as jazz sounds are coming from the street . 
a rather flat film noir that never gets that interesting . it's the simpleness of this tale and lack of any pretensions that makes it convincing but not necessarily sparkling . 
a fairly entertaining charlie chan mystery , but with the new studio monogram taking over for 20th century fox the production values were much cheaper . it wasn't too difficult to pick out the spy , but nevertheless the film was still pleasing in spots . 
it's a visual treat , thanks to the lush camera work of nicolas roeg , but leaves a lot to be desired in its wooden story and characterizations . the point of the film is vincent price's absolutely diabolical performance , no campy routine here . it's a performance showing pure evil and the reward is at the end watching him get his just desserts . charles beaumont's script was intelligent and subtle in making its case about devil-worshipping . but the film itself left me with a cold feeling . 
a terrific cast does not necessarily make for a good pic . the film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess . though , it's entertaining as it takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it takes to be a modern artist , let's us eyeball jodie foster in the nude , and has dennis hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man who wants to be loved and play the sax like charlie parker . he will then give anne a choice : i finish you now , or i let you live and you belong to me . it ends with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil refinery explosion . since none of it made too much sense , the fun to be found in this largely improvised flick is to see if you can get some laughs from how absurd it is . since i only got a mild dosage of laughter out of it , i was only mildly pleased with the flick . originally made for european release under the title catchfire , backtrack wasn't given a general distribution until 1991 . but in 1991 it was given back some cut film footage and released on cable . i would have hated to see the film when it made less sense than it did now . 
this was the fifth 'invisible man' universal filmed in its ongoing series for the money making sci-fier . john fulton's special effects are the unabashed star of this film . there was one very good trick photography shot of jon hall putting his invisible arm into an aquarium , the arm becoming visible like a bubble and then with water delineating his invisible face to make it visible to those he's threatening . but it is the script that does it in , as the invisible man is made into a heartless villain and the storyline was very weak . warning : spoilers throughout the review . before you can say have some coffee , griffin is also invisible--which is the first experiment drury ever did on a human . in this episode it's not the invisible serum that makes the man insane , as the man is already mentally unbalanced . this hokum story could have and should have been more entertaining , but it still had the presence of the legendary john carradine to give the flick some spice to it . but it was still a far come down from james whale's original invisible man . 
a roger corman produced film that is a bookish adaptation from an h . p . lovecraft antiquarian occult work . it maintains the eerie atmosphere by getting into the strange rituals and manifestations required from such a look at the dark side , but fails to prove enlightening and is uneven in its presentation as the ending allows the film to go up in a puff of hokey smoke ( stockwell and begley oppose each other offering up their curses in an undeciferable language , until the evil stockwell gets struck by lightning ) . but this version attempted by director daniel haller ( monster of terror ) , is much better at getting at the freakish meaning of lovecraft than his previous film . that doesn't mean this film is good , just that it's better than the other version . while the brooding dean stockwell seemed right at home with all the weirdness his role called for as a warlock , yet he gave a boring performance as if he was drugged and reduced to speak in a monotone voice throughout . all the chills come from the sounds of an evil wind , the curdling sound of birds eerily singing at the sign of death , the sounds of water splashing , heart's thumping , and of the earth darkening as a shadow covers it . what failed to work , was when haller tried to reduce the visions to some chaotically contrived psychedelic effects . the film should be more interesting for lovecraft fans than to the general audience . i found it , for the most part , to be dull and uninspiring . 
a superficial scare film that makes a feeble attempt to serve up hamlet as its theme , but that's a stretch . it didn't seem believable . he was certainly no bundle of warmth in their hour of need ! it's a film that is devoid of subtlety as its shocks are not surprising and its unfulfilling revenge ending in terms of 'an eye for eye' was poorly scripted ; it also failed to be convincing or scary . it was just another mindless slasher film . the film spends most of its time showing the couple pretending to be nice but still looking creepy . the film has a cold and steely look to it , as feelings on everyone's part are chilly . the house itself is smothered in a cold , aqua blue , as the production designer , jon gary steele , and the director of photography , alar kivilo , have made the set to look like a clone of the antagonistic and cold-hearted terry glass . there was no suspense because if you ever watched any of these formulaic flicks then you will know how this one ends . the film's slow pace for such a slight story bordered on criminality . this is basically a film that put a great effort into getting the sets it wanted to be right , but failed to get anything more out of this absurd tale . it was never believable , but its conclusion was even more ridiculous than it had a right to be . 
this is a film that uses the porn business as its background , but is really about the loneliness and the corruption of an individual . this low-budget indie is mostly a character study of how 'an ordinary guy' such as paul could descend into the seedy world of porno all because he doesn't know how to get a date . he rationalizes his plight by saying in a voiceover , " my parents said sex is a bad thing . " he reasons the quality of the commercial porno films is so poor , he can easily make better films . the film had an anti-septic and unsexy look to it , as its sex scenes were not erotic . it seemed like a film made by outsiders , who took easy shots at the sleaze industry . the film had little emotional impact even though the story was exploitive and aimed to get sympathy for its victims . 
its saving grace is that it is well presented . it is narrated in a serious tone by reed hadley . 
a clich ? heist-gone-sour movie by the british filmmaker antonia bird that has a raw look to it but little else to recommend it . it was bloody , filled with violent action scenes that should please the kind of audience that gravitates toward that sort of thing , and most of all it was very aggressive in attitude without much to say about anything but the criminals . it aimed for style and a maddening fast pace and got both--which makes it entertaining . but the film fails to get you to care for any of these characters , though it tries hard to get you to believe that ray is not a bad guy . this action film is all action and the talk is all cockney , which makes it hard for an american audience to understand . this gutsy crime film with political overtones fails to be convincing . it was not possible for me to believe carlyle has any political insight , never mind him being an idealist . it just seems like another mindless film in a long list of streetwise crime stories that are now hard to remember because they all seem to run together . incidentally , the film's title face--is a cockney term for a gangster . 
this experience he clearly used in boycott , and that plays a major part in understanding the director's continual growth and ability to change . the film is a rambling , action-packed hollywood style ( for the most part ) , surreal , and politically motivated thriller--with car chases and shootouts . it seemed like an apology for a youthful error he made in his personal life that didn't have to turn out with a happy ending . he could have been shot by a firing squad and falsely made into a marxist hero just as easily as the film's hero was , valeh ( majid majidi-a noted director of the father/color of paradise/the children of heaven ) . the film never convincingly showed valeh as anything but a political lightweight without guts , so when he explains while in prison how naive he was to join the terrorists it sounds almost laughable when he says : " i fight , therefore i am . but now i doubt whether i really exist , and therefore i don't care to fight . " not a very good film in mohsen makhmalbaf's opus , but still worth a look to see how much he has developed as a filmmaker , an international personality , and human being since his misspent youth and beginnings as a filmmaker . this remarkable director was born in 1957 . 
this one is set in modern la and filled with pointless violence , and with nothing relevant to say about its dirty cop subject matter . it would have been just another entertaining film that was eye-catching , amusing , and filled with non-stop action but for the last fifteen minutes , when the film fell apart and came up with a very unsound ending and ruined any chance for it to be appreciated in an artistic sense--even for denzel washington's fine performance . the way it ended made no sense , as this smorgasbord in violence had gangs of blacks , mexicans , and even russians , interact with corrupt city law enforcers . for denzel , this is a chance for him to show off how he could be cast against type as the heavy and still be charismatic . if anything , this pic shows that he's up to being a baddie . he's also up to the physical nature of the role as he gives a muscular performance , and he is able to talk the street-talk with the best of them . it becomes apparent that alonzo doesn't follow the book , as he plays mind games with jake and plants the seeds that you either do things my way or it's back to hum-drum police work with no promotions in sight . it was just too much slime to take in for one day , as somewhere after the first half of the film the shock scenes simply wore off and the film lost any dramatic effect ; it just looked cartoonish . but the twists in plot kept coming , and it took us down a seedier and more improbable path . it seemed likely that jake would have gotten off this crooked job offer faster , if this film had wanted to achieve anything resembling reality . the aim was obviously not realism , but to take the story into its own interpretation of the corruption in the lapd which was recently in the news . but the film's major failure is to go anywhere with this material and say anything that was revealing . all the shootouts seemed glossy but the final one seemed totally out of place , of the russian mafia going into action . it left the film to be hung out to dry as just another forgettable exploitation film , even though it was well-acted . 
what we have , is a very cleverly done film , that is in it for the box-office and as an entertainment only film , and it should accomplish both aims , at least , entertainment wise , it is first-rate . it is a good mindless , violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened , such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern ( and , you know how serious that stuff was ) . but do remember , the bad hero , is not all that bad , he is mel , the charming hero of countless adventure films , a guy who is full of good looks and charm , someone audiences love to like , and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers . he also does the voice-over ala noir style , in a deep laconic voice , you know , like a sam spade would do it . the voice-over reassured me that he will live through the film ( that's good , because knowing him , he will be in every scene of this flick , and therefore i'm assured that i will be getting my money's worth of mel . you see , i don't really care what happens to his character in this flick , per se , since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons . what i care about is being entertained , by golly , golly , golly , gee ! ) . payback rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks , ( or maybe , in a certain sense , pays it homage ! ! ! ) and does it with pizzazz . the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago , with its tall buildings and el trains , adding a dark shade to its story . the only thing it fails to pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s and 50s , is that their heroes were really underdogs , they were fighting the system , not out for their own ends and vanity only . this little difference is easy to ignore , but it is bothersome when i see how close mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film . but i'm glad to report , ever so close , but no cigar , tough guy . you just can't imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing . you were both great to look at on screen , you played your hands well , and most importantly , i enjoyed the film , it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing . needless to say , there was not much to the plot for this stylish film , but for those of you who want to know the story line , this is a pure revenge film . action scenes of this heist are super . this gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner . at least , the filmmakers are having fun with this one , and it shows . for the remainder of this slick film , porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself . there is plenty of action , so don't worry you don't have to think of anything when you are watching this flick , everything moves at break-neck speed . these filmmakers have a great eye for detail . so , all-in-all , you have a lot of good action scenes going down , a lot of funny one-liners ( i laughed out loud when porter said , if i was any dumber i would have become a cop . you see , porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses , kristofferson , coburn , and devane ) . i , especially , liked seeing devane , he is a throwback to the old noir foils . there is also an homage scene or a rip off , which ever you prefer , it doesn't matter to me , when porter rips the earring off a drug dealer's ear , taking a chunk of his ear with it . you can't help remembering roman polansky did that in chinatown , a true modern noir film , a film that caught the essence of that genre . the film works for all the above reasons , and most of all it works , because mel is great for the part . 
another feel good type foreign movie , ala the full monty , that seems to please the audience , drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers , and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises , playing down the film's bland politics . a quaint irish village , replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics , a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road , a bunch of likable locals , colorful scenery , wonderful irish pipes heard in the background , and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film , with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it . the only serious flaw in the film , is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie . that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised , by getting rid of the fly in the ointment , the one character in the village that upset its tranquility . they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated . and , of course , there is a wee bit of gossip in the air . the twist in the story is interesting , and if you have not seen the film and do not want to know this twist , please skip the following paragraph and go directly to my grade rating of the movie . now tell me , how many films have you seen lately that can get away with such a corny but happy ending and still be critically well-thought of ? review on 2/27/99 
a cold thriller , exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the public's attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society . in other words , this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films , if that makes sense . by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore , much of this is done off-screen , which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem , the director is able to keep the film arty . they have no redeeming human features , and their cruel intent is played up for the camera's benefit , paul even winks at the camera , as if the audience is in on this game they are playing . in one of the scenes , the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed , but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound . paul calls peter fatty several times to the mock displeasure of peter , tom , beavis , or whoever this obese , snide monster really is . everything about these two is a facade , their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up , their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed , realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film , despite the director's aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation , to reduce everyone to a cartoon image , to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life . that part doesn't work as well as the director might think it does . the family is real to the audience . i am left with the choice of how to rate the movie , knowing full well that the sophist argument is , if you don't like what you are seeing , then don't see the rest of it . that's well and good . and if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material , i can't condemn you for it . i would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater . but i don't think , as the director thinks , in an interview he gave , that people who stay to see the entire movie , really need the movie . i don't , necessarily , need this movie . i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out , and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art , it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently . the film is successful not because of its message , but because it is a well-crafted film , from a filmmaker who knows how to make films , even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of . this film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner , because it is , surprisingly enough , an entertaining film , and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand , that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence . and the hope is , that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better , even if , it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position ; and , that maybe , since violent films are so universally popular , we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence . as far as the critical success of this film goes , i think it is merely a better version of all those halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to--- if you want , a high class texas chainsaw massacre film . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
rudolph takes a rather cynical and tongue-in-cheek view of that art scene , capturing the mood and the atmosphere of that period , shooting this highly entertaining and for him , accessible film , in a dazzling display of color , representative of the art produced at that time by picasso , cezanne , matisse and modigliani . this was actually the first feature film he had in mind , but had to wait to do it until he got backers . his love and understanding of this time period shows up very well , as a result , he creates his best film to date . the parisian scene is topped off by an emotionally sentimental hemingway ( o'connor ) , showing up at all the right parties , sitting at the right cafes , drinking to excess and plying his craft , while thinking aloud , as his philosphy comes off as just so much drivel , with him appearing shallow and hopelessly american despite his presence in paris at precisely the right time for an american to be there . though the story might falter at times , with unneeded boxing matches and stereotyped tourists providing unneeded insights into the parisian scene , what never faltered was how well this film looked and how engagingly it caught the ironies of that period . 
this film doesn't claim to capture the accuracy of its shakespeare production ( it even relishes in the inaccuracies it presents ; ex . , there were no virginia tobacco plantations during that time frame , there was no virginia ) , but the film exuberates in the fun filled spirit and the frolicking nature of the performers and the backbiting that goes on backstage , as it might have been in a 1593 production of a shakespearian play . i had no problem adopting myself to the cleverness of tom stoppard's screenplay , though i am usually turned off by films that think they can get by on that one note . but this film was witty and except for a penchant to become at times a cliched formula plot type of film , borrowed from thousands of other films , you know , the old underdog against the world story , with the underdog winning the big event in the film , in this case , poor will shakespeare against the establishment : that part of the film took away the fresh and innovative dash the film seemed to have on its own terms . but , i was , nevertheless , impressed by the carefree spirit of this romantic comedy , it seemed to encapsulate a feeling for those times when a great poet had to be popular in order to be recognized as great . that shakespeare was a great bard , there is no argument . but that he was at times too worldly , is fair criticism . this film is very clear about that , as a fictionionalized version of shakespeare or not . i was not taken as much with fiennes' fiery performance , as acceptable as it is , as much as i was with the rest of the cast , and especially , paltrow's very appealing performance . fiennes' shakespeare seemed a little too flighty for my taste , i just don't think will was like that and despite this fictonalized account of will , it still bothered me to see him look so lost , at times . you should talk shakesperian english , if you are in a shakesperian production . i found it to be an enjoyable film , full of life and tongue-in-cheek humor to sustain its colorful story within a story , of the needy will , on the advice of a therapist , told to seek some romance to regain his writing ability . will , all added to the splendid feel the director gave to this period piece that rises a little above a typical work of this nature , as the parts of the film that were fictionalized were intriguingly and cleverly done , for the most part . what was a lull in the film , was when its story got too clever for itself and resorted to too much ado over nothing . . . but , after all , there is something mysterious about show business that draws us into its bosom and allows miracles to happen for this not-so-serious look at shakespeare to be dazzling and refreshing , something shakespeare might have looked at with wonder , speculating at who this shakespeare is he is seeing on film . 
elmore leonard novels have become staples for the movies in recent times , they become movies easily translated into money making glossy thrillers , noted for their amusing dialogue and smartly made stories . this film is no exception . it is entertainment for those who like fun pictures , placing no other demands on the filmmaker . clooney and lopez work well together , there is a chemistry between them on screen that belies the unbelievability of the story they are in . the magical attraction between these two , is very cleverly highlighted in this scene . she is intent on arresting him and moving up the ladder in the f . b . i . but to complicate matters , she is also taken with his good looks and charm . the cast is fine . the film is violent , it is sexy , it has romance and comedy in it , in fact , it has just about everything in it , except real intelligence , but then again , what results is a quick-paced actioner , that is easy to watch , and easy for the viewer to let his hair down a bit and be less critical , for this film is a well-conceived star vehicle that works on all cylinders of the entertainment scale . 
these are not pleasant characters , they are sad and funny ; they are pathetic and desperate , but they are definetly not cute or pleasant , and cannot even remotely be thought of as nice people . therefore this romp , down this tawdry road , fits the acting style of james woods to a tee , it seems as if he was born to play these over-the-top , quirky , offbeat roles . and since , it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out , that this film is glued to its brutally violent story line , directed by a director who relishes sleaze , like some have pangs for twinkies , you should have a pretty good idea where this road movie is going to take you ( clark's previous movie was in the same gritty cinema verite style , kids ) . this is the 90s version of that infamous couple's story , just needing a bit more violence and some drugs to tell its tale . the kid very intelligently asks , why me ? what comes next is a learning experience for the young couple , as the kids are treated as if they were full blown junkie grown-ups by their new surrogate parents , treated to champagne and new clothes and lots of dope , but the initial thrill of being a hood begins to change for these druggies , who basically would be content just to make love and sniff some drugs , but are now heavily involved on a trip that is too much for them to really handle . their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths , as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime , still too naive to comprehend their total situation . the problem with the film , despite its authentically-acted characterization , is what can you make out of it that makes sense . since the film can't possibly give us much to say about bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty , we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face , can somehow make it on his own . i recently saw james woods on the charlie rose pbs show , where he talked about his love for this film and belief in it , praising its independently directed efforts and sort of castigating the movie industry ( whenever i hear the term " movie industry " , i can only think in terms of business not art ) for not promoting this film and others like it that are honest efforts , refusing to make formula type of commercial films . i can only concur with him , just wishing that an independent film doesn't necessarily have to be youth orientated or about drugs or violence or sex to sell itself . there are so many other themes out there that have not been so thoroughly explored as these themes have been , and therefore for me to really get on the bandwagon of a film such as this , i just want to see something different already . i am inundated up to my tired eyeballs watching films with the same themes , differing only in the nuances and styles of their story , so that their originality comes intermeshed with one another , causing me to sometimes mistake one film for another . and i think , that is the most critical thing that i can say about this often funny , mostly bleak , derivative film , that was credibly but not compellingly acted , in reality , leaving no visual impact on me , it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and , besides , the enjoyment of it wasn't that great to begin with . 
i was disappointed in hartley's most ambitious film to date ; i expected more than what was delivered . henry fool can best be viewed as an allegory of the good-guys ( non-conformist ) versus the bad guys ( the establishment ) . for hartley aficionados , his comedy is still there in flashes , his trademark drone conversations and absurd situational humor : a marriage proposal takes place between henry and parker while he is taking a wicked dump , this is the best and most powerful scene in the film . but the film is boring at times and belabors its points , and goes on for too long without seeming to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction ; and , is at best , an uneven attempt to say something serious ( which hartley should be applauded for ) . but the film gets bogged down in telling too many different stories , such as , one of domesticity , neighborhood values , and the business of getting published . i wanted to like this film and i thought about why i didn't feel comfortable viewing it for a long time after seeing the movie , and i still found that what i got from the film were some chuckles from the zany characters , but what i was not clear about , was what else i was supposed to get from this film . it just didn't add up as a work of drama , it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character . 
when i was taking college courses in psychology , which is quite awhile ago , i learned that this kind of disorder didn't have to lead to such ill-mannered behavior as melvin displays . which is why melvin's character is more probably a combination of such obsessive/compulsive behavior and a case of rude manners . well , nicholson was real funny doing this compulsive schtick that borders on his just being a turd most of the time , but at his edgiest moments , when he crosses the line of common decency and reaches a point where the audience might not like him anymore , he brought the most laughter to the screen . this " feel good " sitcom looking film , goes on and on for a sometimes hilarious but too often obnoxious two hour and more , as if this was an important film with so much to say , that it couldn't leave out a scene or two or three , as it manipulated some twists and turns into the story line and managed to show melvin at his bigoted worst and then at his most generous best . if you believe such readily made reversals , then you are a better man than me , gunga din . if you believe melvin has changed or if anything is supposed to happen that is for the better in his character , then i guess you believe something i didn't , or couldn't , or rather , i didn't care if i believed it or not , since i sauced it out , real pronto , within the first five minutes of this flick , that the story didn't matter much , this was a cosmetic psychological rendering to a situation that could be real , but that this film was not about real internal changes , but about creating a slickness about its characterizations of people so the audience could have enough laughs at melvin's insensitivity to others and be diverted by that , and walk out of the theater happy to believe that melvin wasn't so bad a guy after all . what saves this film from itself , is that because the actors are so good , this film is actually a hoot in many different ways besides its great one-liners . the actors are really into their roles , getting down pat the minutia of their characters . melvin walks like he's a bit daffy . i love'd that slide step he had , something like jackie gleason did on the " honeymooners " tv show . his outfits were a bland middle-aged man's delight . he'd fit in on any cruise liner . the remainder of the film is predictable and pretty much made up of contrived sitcom stuff . so what does the schlimazel do , he screws it up by saying the worst thing he can possibly say to her . he even refuses to dance with her , which i found to be a truly funny moment in the film . but the film couldn't take a chance of sticking to this unsafe type of humor and went back to its safer plot . and the plot keys in on how melvin is reforming for carol , as it goes back and forth , good melvin , bad melvin , unsure of how rotten or nice a guy they want to make melvin out to be by the film's end . i wonder how many screening polls they must have had , before they came up with the right box office formula for success . in any case , some of my favorite lines in this flick were , simon to melvin , " the best thing you have going for you , is your willingness to humiliate yourself . " how good it couldn't be , at least , has a lot of funny moments to show for its efforts . . . i must say , i thought helen hunt looked a lot like meryl streep . now that's a compliment , helen . 
without john hurt's magnificent performance , he appears in every scene and is very apealing , this film would have fallen flat on its face . oddly enough , he never goes to the cinema ( i could not even imagine anyone living without going to the cinema ) . since he has no clue about how these theaters operate , he mistakenly ends up seeing something called hotpants college 11 . what remains interesting to ponder further is the relationship between the two males . the comic effects of the film seem light enough , that is until the homo-erotic pulsations become overbearing , and we are left , in the end , with a rather awkward drama being played out , that is somehat unnerving to behold , made plausible only by hurt's presence as a commanding performer . yet it is tastefully done , but not as biting as thomas mann's film version of the same theme , death in venice . the message of love and death on long island could fit either pop or aesthetic culture , coming to the conclusion that love is strange . i believe mickey and sylvia had a 1950s hit song about that theme . 
tango is a romantic musical , supposedly influenced by fellini's 8 1/2 , with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood , that is , for a saura film . saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather terse storyline , which means that if you don't care for the tango , you could find yourself bored with this slow-moving story . what is exceptional about this film , is how superbly choreographed and stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is , as its cinematographer is the great vittorio storaro ( last tango in paris ) . one of the tango masters , explains to us that the tango is excellently done when experienced dancers can perform it , so there is one body and four legs in motion . there is lots of innovative dancing and , by mario , there is lots of deep brooding thought about life and what must go into the film to make it arty . we see see a wind machine and the next thing we see is a sultry tango being performed , sets are designed out of seemingly thin air , there are color filters for dance numbers created on the spot , a west side story look alike number is shown with all male dancers . the dancing is good enough to carry this film alone . but the story , that's another story , it just didn't seem that important , including the nebulous surprise ending , which in actuality , detracted even further from the slight storyline . the mood the musical numbers set was so convincingly dreamlike , that for someone like me , who was born with two left feet , i felt like going to a ballroom and trying this elegant dance , even if i never danced the tango before . the dancing remains in my head , and that is what cinema can do to you when it is so stunning to behold . 
this is a gritty , workman-like ww11 hbo made for tv movie , that is much better , surprisingly , than most of those kind of movies usually are , taking place in a battlefield in the hurtgen forest , 1944 , on the border of belgium and germany , though it was shot in hungary . the film is seen through the eyes of pvt . in a year when two epic war films were made , saving private ryan and the thin red line , this low budget movie holds its own with those films storywise , only lacking the great cinematography of those films , but its cinematography was realistic enough , aiding in the clarity of telling the story , that is highlighted by an engaging characterization by ron eldard and the other soldiers who look as if they are really ww11 soldiers . now this has been tried in many of the older ww11 films , but for the most part , it didn't work because the acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are . in such a short time , we feel that we know manning and know what he will do , and that his tough mental attitude seems more realistic than many of the other soldiers we see with a proper military attitude . it is hard to say for sure if we can like a person such as manning , but even as we question his motives , whether or not they are selfish , we still respect him as a man who will not blindly follow orders , even if he has to be insubordinate . this fuzziness about his character holds our interest throughout the film . each of the recent war films i have seen has its own grit and dirt to it , as they seemed to be made nowadays with a new determination to be more realistic and less all apple pie than ever before , as most of the pre-vietnam war films were . i welcome this kind of realistic filmmaking , and since war never seems to go out of style , it is worthwhile seeing how young men fight in such wars , maybe some day all sides will figure out that there is a better way to settle things . until then , there is nothing like a good war film to bring the war into our homes and consciousness , and this one is a reasonably good one . 
roos's first feature film as director , is a snappy , satirical and hip sitcom that is not a sitcom , but is a semi-comedy . it stars ricci , as a bitchy 16-year-old , without any noticeable positive qualities , who begins the film by warning those who don't like her voice-overs , they will be out of luck . this film tells you how smart it thinks it is - that it is so cleverly written , that it can say anything about anyone and get away with it . what remained constantly grating throughout the film , was ricci's snide voice-over comments that were politically incorrect : insulting gays and holding a negative view of sex . she dresses in tartish , campy outfits , and is always smoking a cigarette , adding to the film's theme of being opposite to what is expected of a teen . ricci succeeds in her role of getting the audience to dislike her . but when you contrast the personalities of the men compared to the women , the men leads are bland and affable , while the women all have verve and fuller depth to their characters . how one rates this film , depends on what one is looking for . if it is laughs one is after , there are plenty of them . if it is a well-developed film , not a one -gag movie , then one might be disappointed in the film , as it tended to make one grow weary of its plot and put off by its overly clever voice-over . if one is looking for some deep meaning , then one will be pleased by lovett's reflective statement to lisa , " that sex isn't just for recreation or procreation , but for concentration - that when making love , the experience allows one to relate wholly with someone else so that one can forget their loneliness . " for me , the film was a mixed bag of emotions . since i am not partial to sitcom style movies , no matter how conventional or unconvential they may seem to be , i found myself swaying back and forth , liking some parts of the film and resenting other parts , and just like everything about the film , i was ultimately left in a paradoxical mood . 
thin red line , the ( director : andrew marton ; cast : keir dullea ( pvt . the idea that war is insane is the underlying theme of this violent actioner , that questions the sanity of why men go to war . sgt . the film's title signifies the thin red line that one crosses between sanity and insanity in a war situation . but sgt . the gory combat scenes and the heroics of the men and the craziness of the war , are vividly photographed , leaving one with a mixed impressions , perhaps , wondering if this is what it takes to win the battle , and if that is so , is it worth the price it takes to accomplish the mission . the images of the dead in the swamp , tagged with dogtags in their mouth , was appalling to behold , it is a scene that should leave one feeling a bit eerie . this version of the thin red line is quite different from terrence malick's depersonalized 1998 one . it was a straight hard-nosed story , with no grandiose philosophical themes . its message might be read into sgt . welsh' last words , as he is asked , " why did he take a bullet for someone like doll , someone he didn't even like , " and he responds , " because i'm stupid . " this is a blunt statement , but after all the bloody battle scenes observed , and the heavy losses on both sides , it is a fair question to ask and the response might not be one that can be taken literally , but it is one that is wrapped around a lot of emotions that can't be articulated properly but can sure be felt . 
i have not read the book , but as others who read the book have commented , this is a very difficult work to bring to film because the author's words are so literary imaginative and poetic , such works have in the past resulted in poorly shot films . that is not the case here . demme has sort of solved the literary problem by making this film into a ghost story , as the strong visualizations are used as metaphors for the inhumanity of slavery and the lasting impressions it stamps on the minds of the victims . the frightening and intense emotional mood this film sets is appropriate for the seriousness of the issues it brings to the table , and the deprivation it causes in the country cannot be minimized in any degree , which it isn't here . this is an honest picture , ever faithful to the book's author and the subject matter . but there were definite flaws in this film that detracted from it , such as the poor editing and pace of the film . the first and middle parts of the film dragged on for too long , as it just failed to hold one's attention to the story for long periods of time ; and , it was , also , shot , for the most part , in shadowy night colors making the dark screen unpleasant to watch . what was emotionally moving about the film , were its very striking visualizations , such as the use of the haunted house to make certain that slavery is understood as a haunting experience , that stays with people who experienced it , and that its ills may be deemed permanent for those who can't exorcize the demons slavery has thrust onto the land . the ghost scenes in sethe's house were strong enough messages to scare away any company she might want to have . but i was not crazy about the casting of oprah in the major role of the film , she was certainly adequate for the part ( there was a stoic strength about her that was needed in her performance , and she provided that ) , but she did not show a deep enough range of emotions that a more accomplished actress would have shown . the strength of the film lies in the energy it picks up in its final scenes , as the story clearly came together , and all the images throughout the film began to add up and make sense , and it was able to leave an indelible mark on the viewer that lasts long after seeing the film , in fact , the film gets better when you start thinking about it long after you have seen the film , and only unique , visionary pictures are capable of doing that . that she evolves as the story moves on and learns how to take care of herself , is one of the refreshing surprises that comes about , as kimberley's performance is very gratifying and touching to behold , especially to see how she matures and grows up from her very weak stature in life . beloved's performance is eerie and painstaking , i wouldn't call it a great performance , but it is gut-wrenching to watch how weird she behaves , drooling and stuffing food in her mouth like an animal , as sethe doesn't know how to reach her and love her , yet feels remorseful about her . one of the most powerful lines in the film is when the tender-skinned beloved , who would have been the same age as sethe's beloved if she were alive , says to her , " why you have me ? why you leave me ? " feel that . " i still think that i should have read the book to really feel what " that " is , even if the film was credible enough , i imagine the book is that much more pertinent and that much more powerful than this very interesting and intelligent film , that views slavery in an unforgettable way , perhaps , in a way , that audiences have not visualized the evil consequences of slavery before seeing this film . 
a zippy youth oriented christmas movie ( though there is no bing singing white christmas in this one ) marketed for the druggie generation of post-teens and those in their late 20s , that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's largest share of ticket buyers , as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale , ( pulp fiction type dialogue and style ) , fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace , using the cool life-style in lala land as its backdrop , and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills . in this frenetically paced film , the innovative young director , doug liman , following his indie debut feature , swingers , shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world , as he grapples with their realities , giving us a good look at how they view themselves , their job and their customers . the most amusing bit , is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill , at a party , where those who are there , are so high already , they don't know the difference from one pill to the other . i though fichtner was the funniest and most malevolent one in the film . i don't think the film had much to say about much of anything , including the use of drugs , but it hit hard at being an hilarious film , with its fast-paced mood swings , its sharp editing cuts and frequent light changes , allowing its story to be easy to watch , and imbuing the characters with a certain attitude about them , that made their performances seem eclectic . i especially liked sarah polley , when she wasn't on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose . in any case , go has watch ability because of its raw energy , and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high . yet the film for all its innovative features , still could not escape , from being on the edge of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking . the film's appeal is still mostly with the younger generation . they are the ones who are mostly likely to be amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves , while the older generations might not be as amused , and feel put off by the lack of any character depth or real wit in the story . and the benign ending , not only didn't make sense , but seemed artificial and embarrassing to watch . it was as if this film after using all its energy in rebellion , now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending . 
it is filmed with calm detachment , in black-and- white , giving the film a taut look , as the action is sharp and ruthless , by men who are all business . it is interesting to see how melville could make a low level hood like gus , into a seemingly ethical person , that is , within the standards of the criminal mind , and be deemed as an almost sympathetic and , at the same time , pathetic figure , whose crime spree , though unforgiveable , will nevertheless , offer us something about him that is redeeming , that even the wily inspector bleu recognizes . this is not great noir , because the acting seemed jarred , but it has a certain tension in it that sustains its somber mood . 
when i look at the deep south , the first thing that comes to my mind is their history of racial problems . what altman has done , is paint a picture of the town , full of local flavor , trying to test us to see if we guessed right at what our first impressions of the locals was , as those of us who have not kept up with the changes in the south or have not been brought up there , might view things from an outdated way of seeing the new south , thinking the worst of them , but now surprised to find that the only thing that has not changed about our perceptions of the south , is how dull witted some of them can still be . altman's other aims are to uncover all the town's little nasty secrets that is so easily hidden by its southern hospitality and history of racism . though , the tone of altman's film is always light and never very haunting . this is one of his mild films , he doesn't penetrate deeper than the story itself takes us , even if it is tightly directed , with no visible flaws in the storyline and the film's purpose , everything about it turns out to be as pleasing as the smell of magnolias in the spring , and thereby we are cheated into seeing something that could have been most revealing , instead we are offered something that is really too bland and simplistic for its own good , even if it is a satisfying film , it is still most easily categorized into the " feel good " type of mold , something altman might have winced at in his heyday of filmmaking in the 70s . what is comical or tragic , depending on what kind of a sense of humor you have , is watching how the crime scene is being trampled on , and the murder investigation done in such an amateurish way , that the investigators of the little jon benet ramsey murder in boulder , colorado , would look like scotland yard investigators in comparison to this sheriff's department . their romance is a series of lustful encounters , that is mostly comical , as it adds to the story , by giving it a more local flavoring . now this is as far a cry from the old mississippi , as one can imagine , though there are still some lingering subtle racial prejudices around . which , i guess , could best be understood as a very logical statement by those who were brought up in a small-town . the film ends on cora's spiteful comment to her sister , as she sticks to the story her controlling sister gave her , that it wasn't a suicide , as she triumphantly exclaims , " i did good , didn't i ? " the film's decency shines through all the past racial injustices , and maybe things are getting better in the south , at least that is the message we are left with , and i see no reason to be of a different opinion . but that last framed shot of the sheriff and emma and the lawyer and willis sitting on the dock fishing was a little too rosy a picture for me to take in all at once . race relations might be the biggest problem americans are still faced with , and finding a cordial way out of it is the aim of a lot of good folks . the weakness of this film , is that its over-all decency is not moving enough of an experience to make this anything but a mildly entertaining film , that captured a little something about the south's past and future , and made us feel a little better that we saw it , but did not set off any bigger sparks , or really create any excitement about the town or its inhabitants that is worth taking note of . 
this is a true-to-life portrait of one of this century's most celebrated artists , as the film covers his work from the periods of the 1960s- through the- 1970s , as bacon's specialty in the macabre is examined , as is also his spectacle of what is horrific , but the film offers very little concrete arguments for him to be considered as a great artist ( we saw none of his paintings on display ; i realize that this was no fault of the director , since bacon's estate refused to grant permission for their use ) . that he is a great artist , is of course , a debatable subject ; but what is not subject to debate , is the brilliant performance by derek jacobi ( a virtuoso one ) and the fine supporting performance by his lover who is the foil for all his nasty wit , daniel craig ( george ) , as both exhibit a forcefulness and a subtly for their character that leaves no doubt that they have mastered their subject rather well , leaving no sharp stone unturned , so to speak . in the very first shot , bacon is diabolically smelling the pillow from an obvious lover who just left his flat , an image that reminded me so much of hannibal lecter in the silence of the lambs , and his extrasensory capacity for smell . that george and he are almost complete opposites , able to use each other for whatever it is worth , is part of the fascination of the bleak material covered , as the film becomes an exercise in excesses and debauchery , that is covered so wantoningly , with bacon referring to his relationship with george at one point , as the man who does odd jobs for him once in a while . that his precarious lifestyle often shines as brightly as his visual images , as his oeuvre of work is presented to us through these visions , rather than seeing it as on framed paintings , and this is stupendously done by a brilliant stroke of filmmaking , as the artist's soul was seen crawling out of the recesses of his warped but talented mind , as distorted lenses and mirrored images and shaded colorings and quick editing of the images , were all effectively used to enhance the eeriness of the artist's visions . i must confess , i never cared for bacon's art , though i was somewhat impressed with the raw power of his blood curling images and the deathlike objectivity he gives his work . but i was put off with his inability to reach farther back into the human soul and see what the whole being is like as the truly great artists such as a blake or durer can , who know both good and evil . to know one of the contraries is not enough , as it probably means that you can't even see that as clearly as you should , as in bacon's case , what evil is for him to see , is mostly felt as a raging flux inside , something jacobi captured on screen , that made this film a very special one , and saved it from the doldrums it could have been . it is rare that an actor can really sense the mood and spirit of an artist , because when he doesn't , it is to the detriment of the film , no matter how good the story is or who the artist is that is being portrayed . what comes to my mind is the risible performances of charlton heston as micheangelo and kirk douglas as van gogh , or more recently leonard di caprio trying to be convincing as an unknown artist in titanic . their lack of credibility as artists , were enough to make the films they were in seem phony . off hand , i can only think of derek jarman's caravaggio , to match this one in intensity and homosexuality , and integrity of performance . but whatever i think of bacon and his art work or the unwatchable moments this film had , and the pangs i got from his negative philosophy , and how the story was going down a cul-de-sac , i was nevertheless , still dazzled by a performance from derek jacobi , that left me breathless , and by a first time director , who is in every mannerism an artist and feels like an artist does , and was able to translate that inspiration onto the screen , which is no easy feat to do . 
the male stars keep the film flying along . billy bob might just be the best character actor in the movies today . i just wish cusack would lose that coy smile he seems to bring with him in every role he has , it is starting to wear tiredly lame on him . these stars make their characters seem more real than they have a right to be , because the story is just too thin to carry much weight on it , except to follow its commercial instincts and provide the audience with enough obvious action sequences to keep the pace of the film moving at jet speed , allowing hardly any time for one to sit back and think about the real turbulence that could have been experienced about traffic controllers' stress from the job . the chaos and controlled confusion in the tower , and close camaraderie waffling in the air between the controllers and even their bosses was fun to watch , as well as giving the audience a chance to be looking over their shoulders at the computer screens they work with , giving an accurate and colorful view of the job they do . it is really astonishing that a film about traffic controllers wouldn't even mention the most startling event that ever happened to them . i'm afraid that scenes such as this one , are the only redeeming features of this comedy/romance that saved it from crashing . 
an independent film , shot for around $250 , 000 , that lacks a cutting edge , something indie films should not leave home without . it sure looks like a hollywood studio film to me , but with a little bit of spice thrown in to give it some oomph . it is a story about swingers , which should be a revolting topic and is , for most of the film , nevertheless , there is humor to be found . the gang is made up of actors looking for work , coming to hollywood to be where the action is . unfortunately , we have to hear this whining for most of the film , until he acts natural , and bingo , something good happens to this dude , who i must fess up and say , i felt nothing at all for . and the boys will be boys theme is played here to the hilt , as sex is always foremost on their mind . that he is clearly the winner at the end , gives the film the right perspective it needs , not to fall into its own cool lingo trap . he represents the heart and soul of the swingers and gives the film a comedic tone , that at times , as silly as it is , is downright funny . what irked me most about the film , was how the filmmakers seemed proud that they ripped off tarantino's style of film , claiming everyone rips off everyone else . the problem with that logic , is that this film doesn't look original , it looks and feels like all those other tarantino clones . it smacks of wannabe actors being made into a film by wannabe directors and writers . if you have a strong stomach and can take the staleness of the story , you might find it funny enough , and actually enjoy it , realizing , in all seriousness , that this is the way it is for many heterosexuals , and it is always hard to change the way it is , no pun intended . 
there is no doubt about the oppressiveness of the chinese communist regime , and this film , more than any other that i have seen , recently , presents the devastating emotional conflicts the communist revolution has done to its people , even though , it is not overtly critical of them . it is beautifully filmed in the style of a formal chinese landscape painting , using the commonplace to be viewed as something that goes beyond its present linear form , to give it an eternal flavor from what it might first appear like . the narrator tells us that in chinese , umbrella sounds very similar to separation . he is so insignificant to the story , that we never even see him . he mails most of the money he stole to qiuyi , and he gives enough for xiao to have a week's worth of pleasure . that is about as optimistic as it gets for this bitter tale of politics and romance , told from a woman's point of view . this is a very serious , stylized film , artistically filmed with many long angle camera shots , that give the film a depth that goes beyond the mere telling of the story , though it seemed to be dragging it heels at times , as the story just hit dry spots in it . its use of color cinematography was startling , as yellow was most effectively used to both evoke a sense of renunciation and hope . this is a most interesting but not particularly penetrating film to come out of modern china , one that is most blunt and cruel in picking up the human travails and emotional discontentments that the people faced in the hands of their liberators , but not able to say too much about why these hardships are taking place . 
all the main characters are coeur d' alene's of idaho . there are many odd characters that add to our awareness of the native american experiences on the reservation , who are both amusing and talkative . but life on the reservation seems stale and confining ; yet , everyone , at least , has some material comforts , as they all seem to live in a house and enjoy their fried bread . film takes on the look of a road film . this is a film written , directed , and acted by native americans . it does not suffer from the usual clich=e9s of indian films , as it artfully weaves a story wavering between despair and comic acceptance of the native american plight . i recommend this film for its verve and very real passion it has for native americans , despite the triteness of its story and the fact that it offered no new insights into child abuse , resolving the father-son relationship only posthumously . i mainly point this out , since one of the major underlying themes of the film , was just that problem . 
monument ave . what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood . the film is seen through the eyes of bobby , the film's low-life protagonist , we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots . that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to . it all seems so pointless . monument ave . works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there . they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up . but , even with all this bravado , they feel and act like losers . as the message is simply , that nothing changes here . 
clint eastwood has directed a so-so , pleasantly watchable , leisurely-moving film , marked by two outstanding performances . the other is by kevin spacey . there were just too many zanies , causing me to overdose on them . so much of the film seemed to be taken up by these artificial and embarrassingly contrived characters , and not enough to the interesting story that was developing . to the film's credit , it takes no fixed position on the sexual morality questions that come into play . it seems that almost everyone in town has some sort of a pistol , as much is made of the guests carrying pistols to the party . so the killing by pistol doesn't become the big issue , but the fact that jim has come out of the closet , that does not seem to be tolerated in savannah's high society or by the ordinary folks who will make-up the jury . the film then turns into a courtroom drama , and sonny seiler shines as the silky tongued , good ole country boy lawyer . he just seems to get by with that cute smile of his . the film suffers from any real emotion , as it is difficult to be too concerned about the victim or the accused , or for that matter , any of the denizens of savannah . it is interesting to note that the real sonny seiler played the judge . spacey's charm and wit carry this film about as far as it can go , before the meandering story , and the non-mystery of the main event come to fruition . we are left with a colorful , well photographed piece , trying to subtly make a statement on morality . but that didn't work for me . yet , i still found enough good things in the film to say that it might not please everyone , but it did catch the proper atmosphere in savannah and provided an entertaining look at the people who dwell there . 
it asks the question , how would you react in finding out that your world is not real ? this is a theme a number of '90s sci-fi films have already done . it seems as if the movies are running out of ideas for this world and need the after-life for more material . supposedly , i am being prepared for a film that will make me think . instead , what i got was a sci-fi film that left me somewhat confused by its being both a murder mystery and a time travel sci-fi'er . it was very difficult to keep track of what was going on , as the film moved back and forth between two different time frames . it was also difficult for me to grok what is meant by the creation of parallel dimensions and how it is possible for our world to be a copy of another . what made it even more difficult , was that the story line was built around the murder case and not around the more interesting ideas generated by time travel . yet , it was this virtual reality computerized world that left me dazzled with its engrossing ideas . though the film tried , it simply couldn't create too much depth for its characters . they remained tied to the sci-fi part of the story . they performed their task well , but their characters couldn't expand because of the limitations they were presented with . they just didn't have too much sparkle to them . even the romance between the leads was jejune . this proved to be a fatal flaw in the film . these creations have feelings and emotions just like people ; but they don't know they're not real . it is too dangerous . yes . the 13th floor , directed by josef rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with ravel centeno-rodriguez can be valued for its re-creation of a 1937 los angeles of fancy bars , booming oil wells , and a magnificent wilshire boulevard setting . all this ostentation taking place in the middle of our great depression . it was fun to see this opulent depiction of a town that was to only grow more opulent and depressed in the future . in this most original story , it seems hannon has made one too many simulations himself and now wants to abort this project . i got mixed messages from this film . i thought it was an interesting concept , that somehow didn't seem as exciting as it should be on the first viewing . i will reserve final judgment on it , since i think it could look better upon seeing it again . as for the flatness of the characters , that i'm afraid won't change . but i must say , i thought the actors did a really fine job considering the limitations placed on them by the script . . . also , the filmmakers did a good job with their use of costume and set designs . i wanted to like this film more than i actually did , but i couldn't fully enjoy it , for the simple reason that too much of the film was taken up by the uninteresting murder case . 
this escapist movie is sponsored in part by sega , influenced in part by the death threat on indian author salmun rushdie , and it sure feels like a '60s bad acid trip ala video game that the twelve game players in the film are into . burroughs influenced cronenberg with the idea that what you create as an artist becomes a living thing , it goes out into the world and has a life of its own but is still connected to you . so far , so good . it is pronounced with philosophical pretensions as " eggs is tense . " and two heads are better than one . these could be some slogans for a game that has no explanation or purpose for its existence . you get to know about it only when you play it . to play the game , means you have to penetrate the body by means of bio ports , which are openings in the spine . that's a fleshy lump with several nipples , and it's meant to be stroked by game players . you see the obvious allusions to sex in the game's foreplay . all this game stuff is really not that interesting to see . the two stars are only mildly diverting , arousing no particular warm feelings for their plight . their aim is to provide suspense and a dark sense of humor , which they do on occasion . but they fail in achieving any depth in their characters ; therefore , they are seen only as being the game figures they are portraying . the main supporting cast includes willem dafoe as gas and ian holm as kiri . both in minor roles . he replies , " only on the most pathetic level of reality . " kiri is a game character who talks with a thick european accent . for allegra , her pod is vital , as it holds the only formula to the game in it . the film sinks downhill from here on . but much of the story just didn't add up and the virtual reality didn't look so hot , either . the only thing left to be accomplished was a surprise ending , and that comes as sure as a heart attack . the only thing is , that the surprise ending really came too late too save the film , and if you thought about it , it didn't make sense , unless you believe that the two best game players were ironically the one's who were really anti-gamers ; that is , inspite of their negative energy they were still able to excel in the game . he said , " tell me the truth , are we still in the game ? " cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film , he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles . the biggest mistake was in the casting of jude law as a romantic hero . virtual reality story left me thinking that it could have been done with more fluidity and feeling . 
what i learned right off the bat from this experimental documentary styled film about the director's search for his nazareth palestinian roots , is that in the holyland souvenir shop , the " holy water " comes from the tap and has a cross put on it to make it look authentic . deception is not a new thing in the middle-east , so whatever is said about this birthplace of the world's three major religions , bears careful scrutiny and should be taken with a proverbial grain of salt . that caveat goes also for this personal film about what it means to be a palestinian living today in a country that is hostile to its culture . it comes in two parts and with two different moods ; the first , nazareth : a personal diary , is nonchalant and disconnected . the second part is entitled , jerusalem : a political diary , is biting and meant to be disturbing . the closing shot is politically charged with the question of what does it mean to be an israeli arab in today's israel . the tv program his parents were watching ends and the station plays the israeli anthem and we see the picture of the israeli flag on the screen . this symbolically points to the explanation of " disappearance " in the film's title , indicating that it is , indeed , the palestinians he is talking about who are disappearing without a homeland . since the film was made , there have been many ongoing changes in the palestinian situation , with a homeland probably in the future cards of the peace negotiations . but this is the middle-east we are talking about . what is expected always comes with a surprise . the film is the most sensible when it humanizes the arabs it introduces us to , who are for the most part apolitical , middle-class , and non-violent . this in itself , is quite different from most films about this volatile subject . the following events that took place in the film's first part give us some inkling about the character of the palestinians : we watch a bunch of old women chew the fat while peeling garlic . one of them says , " it's raining culture . " the second part of the film shifts dramatically to jerusalem and the pace quickens , as the film also becomes more bizarre . this gives us cause to believe that she may be a terrorist . " jerusalem is not unified . . . jerusalem this version of israel's national anthem sounded malevolently strange . it was the most powerful image in the film , offering a menacingly striking note . the last one finished nearly doesn't make it into the van rushing off on an emergency call . this segment alone would qualify this work as an art film . to use nazareth and jerusalem , two cities governed by israel , not the palestinians , and imply that this is palestine , is perhaps wishful thinking on the part of first time director elia suleiman . in any case , it is controversial , and a sure thing to aggravate the israelis . one-third of the film's budget came from the israeli fund for quality film and the rest from the national endowment for the arts . this as you can well imagine , making a film about this subject matter is very touchy , indeed . this film succeeded in being provacative without being openly a hostile political one . it works because it gets its urgent message across through the use of irony and offers a step in the right direction for people who live so close together but do not know each other and have hated one another for too long a time . that is not to say that this film is not openly in favor of one side over the other . but , at least , there is an air of civility about it that provides some hope for a future peace in that region of the world . what this film indicates , is that the learning process has to be continuous and have some room in it to make people look and act human . comedy is a good weapon against such racial hatred , and some of the sketches presented here were quite effective . the film's rambling , non-linear structure may turn some people off it even more than its politics does . as with most personal and original material , there are parts of it that remain obscure . perhaps , it is a more entertaining film to its creator and his supporters than to others . 
a gorgeously filmed fable taking place in the steppes of southeastern iran , about the nomadic ghashghai tribe noted for the handicraft of their beautiful carpets . she appears like an attractive apparition sitting by the stream , where sometimes she is seen smiling sweetly and other times sadly reflecting the pains she feels in her tender heart , clad in a traditional dress , which is an ornate blue color that matches the carpet . to fully appreciate the tale , which is told in the same fanciful manner these simple nomads weave their carpets , one must suspend one's reality and enter into a fairy tale land of richly decorative colors and visions , and take heed as gabbeh sings her heartfelt song that " love is color " and that " love is pain . " we see the carpet as if were a magical one as it is spread out on the water . for those who value persian rugs , they realize this is so because of the all stories and detail that go into the carpet , making it an inspired work of art that gives it its intrinsic value ; it is a work of art that is unrivaled precisely because it is made without set patterns . the film was originally sponsored by the persian carpet industry hoping to have it made as a documentary . but if you can ignore that , you will see a film that turns out to be so endearing , that you will be taken in by the power of its raw beauty . this seems to be too much for the young girl to endure . i quite frankly don't understand all the cultural ramifications of the tale and what the exact meaning of its conclusion amounts to , but that didn't hinder me from being amazed by the stunningly lush landscapes seen and from enjoying the film as is . iranian films of this nature require a different way of looking at them , something that american audiences might take a lot of getting used to . this artistic ( not poetic ) film , is one that is not necessarily better than american films , as much as it is different from them . don't look for the usual hollywood formula contrivances to drive the film to its conclusion . this fairy tale film is a feast for hungry eyes ( i can't get over how the wheat fields depicted looked so much like van gogh's ) . but , with that being said , i would be remiss if i did not mention that this simple tale , is one that has almost no insight into modern iran ; it is a popular film , aimed at upsetting no one-- foreigner and iranian alike . if i had to compare it with an american type of film it most closely resembles , i would have to say a " disney " film . in other words , this is not a personal film , one in which the director's poetical vision is inspirational . instead , it is a safe non-political , though , beautifully shot romantic fantasy , that is more pleasing to the eye than to the mind . it is one to be admired , as one does a beautiful woman , but it is not one that invites further introspection . 
rappaport's debut film is a black comedy that has all the eccentricity exhibited in his later films , but without the polish he was able to develop for his more accomplished works . that this film is an adequate entry into his oeuvre of independent films , is certainly true . as always , a rappaport film is marked by the absurd way its characters are presented and by its low budget . homage is paid here to such classic movies as sunset boulevard and johnny guitar , as these are viewed on tv by the neurotics featured in the film , whose lives seem more unreal than what they are watching on screen . there were at least eight other little episodic dramas , other than the one just referred to- of the lady who wakes up in the morning , whose only aim in life is to watch films on tv for the whole day . but the scene is played back ala rashomon , giving the man's version which is different from hers . all these episodes feed into the off-the-wall fun the narrator has in describing the action taking place , which he narrates in a mock serious tone . the way the lives of these lonely new york city denizens are presented , make for an original film , though not a complete one , but one that is worth seeing for those who don't mind seeing something a bit different . 
it is one of those extra long ( 230 minutes ) and slowly paced films , that is a chore to stay tuned into . one deserves to get a c in audience 101 , for just remaining awake while watching it . it doesn't help that the characters are not appealing and do not draw us into their story . the thing here is history as mixed in with the loose telling of aeschylus' oresteia tragedies-- characters are even named orestes , electra , and chrysothemis . we see them in towns that appear to be shabby and depressing , as the years keep changing , as does the political climate . things certainly look glum ; the only cheer comes from the actors , as they are transported through the far-out regions of greece and sing their rhythmic songs of freedom , love , and sadness with a dignity and verve that enraptures the film in a very moving mood . you can feel the pulse of the times through the music and realize that big events are happening to the people of greece . the film assumes a lot for a foreign audience viewing it , that they would be knowledgable about greek political happenings and of the greek tragedies and of its history . the modern greek history of betrayal , revenge , and redemption are both the subtle and underlying themes of the story , as seen through the eyes of the weary acting troupe . in the most moving scene of the film , the actors bury him and start applauding him for the life he lived as he is buried ; it is as if they were saying , what a performance you gave in life . most of the film was unfortunately not as stimulating and was too trying a task to follow in all its different kind of historical rejoinders , even though this is a worthy film , visually bringing real life into focus , in a way that is unique and psychologically absorbing . there is no doubt about it , this is a theo angelopoulos film , not relying on cohesiveness of plot or dialogue to tell its story for the record of history . his camera moves around for many different and enticing angle shots but his takes go on forever , touching every little gesture and staying with them for minutes at a time without any action taking place , making the film a very difficult watch for most non-greeks . the neutrals just tried to please those in charge at the time . theo angelopoulos is a great filmmaker , but this first feature of his to achieve international recognition is not a great film as much as it is a vital telling about political intrigue . it is a film that is relevant ; a good peek at modern greece and how it is politically divided . my hat is off to anyone who can say they were enthralled with this entire film , not the pieces of it here and there like i was . 
there was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek photography magazine , frame , that is the subject of the film , and the film itself , with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion , all in the pretense of art . it is a performance that makes the film seem greater than how it really is . the complications that arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot . the two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions , with the more controlling lucy being in charge of things and instigating the relationship to be more sexual . she has most of the lines in the film that pack a wallop . the combo of the three women with different intentions and personalities , plays well , as the acting here is really fine . all the actors were properly ensconced in their roles and supported each other very well . eventually the film , after being carried along by sheedy's intense performance , dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness ; it ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance , and it was highly questionable that the " art " seen was really worthy of being deemed as something special . we just lost interest in the characters , the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't stop and get to the main article . so what could have been cutting edge dramatics , if the lesbian romance was followed through further , turns out to be a film not about art , but more of a soap opera story , about how three women , at different stages of their life , get together and separate . all the pain that is there , is finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they don't want to handle any more . which left the film only somewhat satisfying ; it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters , and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart . but we only get a voyeurs look at them , and that is not enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of mind-games and drug induced delusions and need for each other . the film just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film ; that it wanted to say something more about syd's sudden sexual reversal and about the despair in lucy's life , but it just couldn't get it out what it wanted to say , which is why the film became a let down . its style was , perhaps , too beautiful for its own good . it would have been wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen . being a talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person , as evidenced by lucy's dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making . 
there is something to be said about simplicity : it is unencumbering . to shoot a film about a weekend excursion , shot in 16mm and on a high-8 video hand-held camcorder and have it shown in theaters , as the picture jumps back and forth during the entire film , making it really annoying to view , and have the audience be understanding about this , means that this film , shot as if it were a true documentary , has captured something genuine on screen that an audience is craving for . it also should move it into cult film status for these 5 central florida university film school students ( 3 actors , writer and director ) , who should be proud of their achievement , accomplished by having a sound idea and made without hardly any money for its production ; the only other thing needed by them was the conviction to do their own thing and in their own way . it is the horror on their faces and the way their expressions show real apprehension that give this film a different twist to it than the usual horror story , which , too often , relies on special effects . it matters not what is seen along the way or how well they are acting , professional actors could not have done a better job . this makes the last minute of the film the most haunting part of it . it sticks with you well after viewing it , as you wonder what could have happened to them . it reminded me somewhat of " picnic at hanging rock " , that film also effectively left the disappearance up to the imagination and did not dwell on the details of the children's demise . this method of filming mysterious disappearances , proves to be an interesting way of handling it , especially when you don't have much in your budget and your story is razor thin . the flaws in this project are that it was like going on the trek yourself , walking over bumpy logs , getting wet , and feeling cold and uncomfortable , and listening to all those snidish remarks and whining that came out of the three . i would not like to see other films made this way , or see a follow-up to this film , a film that lucked out and became an enormous commercial success , which should make " big time " movie producers drool with envy . this film , just happened to capture the spirit of the project and was done in a satisfying way so as to reassure us that we were seeing something that appeared to be genuinely creepy . follow-up films rarely capture the same spirit , and by correcting the jumpy camera would not , necessarily , enhance the film . this film did what it had to do and should be savored as the popular cult film it is or will certainly become . it made a virtue out of shooting a low-budget and unsophisticated story in the raw . the other thing the film didn't do , was give us enough information about the legend . i would have felt more toward the effort , if i had more of a story and some more pertinent dialogue to go along with the scariness of the film . it was also hard on the ears to hear their conversations , both because of the poor sound quality and their endless ramblings , punctuated only by profanity . but this is overwritten by their excellent use of the forest itself , its twigs ( designed to give the film its terrifying logo ) and rocks and darkness , as in one sense the area was found to be beautiful , but when things went wrong , an ugliness of mood and environment set in , giving the film all the props they would need to make this horror film scary . i would give it an a if it was shown to a film school class and held up as an example of how to make an innovative film on practically nothing . but as a professional offering , i would be more critical , and my overall discomfort in watching the film would have me lower the grade significantly . though i do heartily recommend this film for the more adventurous sorts , and feel it is difficult to evaluate because of the thinness of the story and such , yet it has an appeal to it that goes beyond what we ordinarily look for in a film . that something special is what draws us to this film , but not to a point where we remain uncritical of it . the film leaves the elements of mystery about it , as its ending is very much connected to its beginning interview scenes of the locals , which should provide many provocative responses from the enthusiasts of this film , who will add mystery onto the mystery for this most dizzying and engaging film . . . incidentally , i did feel like i was motion-sick when i left the theater . i wonder how many others felt that way ! 
barlach's grumpy demeanor , the strange circumstances of the case , and the unsettling swiss countryside , add a noir feel to this b & w film . martin ritt , who is usually a film director , plays his part with all the right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting . he reminded me a lot of peter falk's columbo . voight is a good counterbalance to ritt and to robert shaw's one-dimensional nazi-like villain role . he is able to bring an energy into the investigation , something that makes the implausible situation seem a little bit more plausible . but the ending , when all the game plans come together , left me slightly irked-- this easy to watch film , just didn't add up . it seemed as if the story tried too hard to make sure that man's sense of justice won't be mocked anymore , and i just couldn't buy into its easy solution , especially when for most of the film , confusion was the telling story . 
ten days' wonder , the ( decade prodigieuse , la ) ( director : claude chabrol ; screenwriters : paul g ? gauff/paul gardner/eugene archer ; cinematographer : jean rabier ; cast : orson welles ( theo ) , anthony perkins ( charles ) , marlene jobert ( helene ) , michel piccoli ( professor ) , 1972-fr . ) chabrol continues to make original films in his own inimical style , some very successful , others not quite hitting the mark . this one is a theological mystery that is done in english , from an ellery queen novel . it is supported by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that will involve adultery , madness , blackmail , deception , jealousy , theology , and murder . its results are mixed , being that it succeeds as something different from most thrillers but , it is rather chaotically done . at times it looks as if it were a b- movie . perkins' over-the-top portrayal of the manic charles is eye catching . the film begins to make sense if you view it from the unique theological spin it puts on the story . this unique film is both awkward and mesmerizing , and at all times tantalizing our sensiblities . it seems to want to question how deep our faith is in god , which is a recurring theme in many chabrol films . the answers are skewed , as chabrol is cynical enough to believe that the rich can get away with anything , including murder . but theo remains godlike , charming the public and buying them off with his wealth , making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side . this is a film that might seem better the second and third time you view it than it does at first . 
this is not the way the american dream is meant to be earned . it can only be attained by the honest means of hard work and fair play and through one's ability . kruger also has the best line in the film , when he tells chippy , " i admire loyalty , but not to the wrong people . " 
it's kitsch all right ; but , nevertheless , fine storytelling by the former nyu film school graduate m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) , makes this moody ghost piece palpable . this well-crafted mystery , is a first-rate summer entertainment vehicle , flaws and all--one large ( the story if examined carefully , especially leading up to its surprise discovery , would not hold up to careful scrutiny , it's all really hollywood hokum ) , one medium ( ghosts can't move physical objects around , this is pure hollywood invention ) , and one minor ( ghosts don't leave marks on one's body , though that was a ploy that added questions about parental abuse to the story , making it fit into a modern problem in society ) . this , afterall , is quite a burden for the lad to have on his small shoulders . haley's fright is convincing because he does not over emote the role but plays it as a child would who knows that adults don't like to hear things that are not understood by them . so he speaks in a low , almost hushed voice of haunting terror , adding punch and gravity to his hallucinations and ghost stories , making his frightful experience seem real . what helps this story out enormously , is that almost everyone you speak to has some strange tale themselves to tell about their contacts with a dead person . if you don't believe that , take note of the popular psychics , such as a james van praagh , and see how many calls they get about relatives communicating with those who are departed . most psychics would say that the dead choose to communicate with those who are most receptive to them , and that they might just be asking for some help from someone not realizing that they are dead or they are trying to help someone they care about see something that only they can see . i don't think this film added much to our knowledge of the paranormal , but it was an entertaining film , plus it showed how a murder can be solved by having a sixth sense ( something that police sometimes find valuable in solving a crime ) . the story was mildly chilling , showing the boy's visions of the dead people as real , but without the gore that follows many of this genre's usual commercial horror stories . . . this escapist film allows you to take pleasure in this supernatural hokum ; perhaps , even making you feel satisfied by the film's surprise ending , as you will probably not give this film another passing scary thought : accepting it for the hollywood hokum it is , thinking more about the cleverness of the plot than about whether or not ghosts exists . i didn't find anything deeper than a good story told here , and for that , the filmmaker did an admirable job . 
what sparkles through the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast , who are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful and their story worth telling . these four unlikable men indulge us with how they prey on the weak . these men are not just materialists and users of people , but are truly depraved human beings . eddie , as the central figure of the story , is probably the one who is the most out of it , either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what is real and what is false . because of the sharp dialogue and the ability of the actors to get under the skin of their characters , this morbid look at humanity seems poignant . its humor is in the form of sarcasm and scorn , which is a mean-spirited way to look at others , though mickey says he is flip not sarcastic . his retorts and dry comebacks are flip humor used in the sense that we are all going under , so why be that serious about life ! it is ruptured when eddie finally tells him with cruel honesty , we need guys like you in hollywood to make the bullshit look real . you're expendable . you do not matter . this is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great acting and intriguing dialogue . even a long lasting relationship between eddie and phil can't be viewed as necessarily a sincere one . " phil is very safe , because no matter how far you manage to fall , phil will be lower . " as an interesting gesture to the media age of the 1980s , drazen uses the tv images we view from the channel-changing eddie , showing how meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen : tragedies , wars and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the media but all meld into insignificance in one's daily life , with no follow-up search for the truth in these stories taking place . this was a tough film to like and an even tougher film to hate . its appeal is hypnotic , in the sense that we are overhearing conversations we shouldn't be hearing but we can't stop listening to them . if we met these types in our personal lives , more than likely , we couldn't stand to be around them long enough to be sufficiently entertained by them . for two hours to see them on film is also too long to be around them . an 80-to-90 minute film , honed down and made more mobile , taking away some of its staginess , would have suited me just fine . 
to make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult , but to make documentaries for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically dangerous , therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those governments . kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film , and in some ways this film is semi-autobiographical , as it is about what power there is in the camera , especially for one who is an artist . philip is the central focus of the film , as he undergoes a transformation of personality . it seems that even though he didn't intend to , he hurts those who are not responsible for what he does . this is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in communist poland and a comedy , as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies . the power in the story was in the subtle reminders , showing that behind the obvious censorship , there is a real censorship problem for everyone , it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities-- but , for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved . poland is a good example of such a battlefield , with the then state-owned film industry in charge of funding projects , documentary films are sometimes the best records of such history , unless you have the artistic deftness , like kieslowski has shown , to make a film as wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors . since the film's theme has been done many times before , and the comic efforts of the film were rather flat , what made this film provocative , was the absorbing performance by jerzy stuhr , who would become a regular in many of the director's later films , which spanned a career of over 20 years . and for showing that struggle through stuhr's eyes , the film is memorable , though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works , yet it is still worth seeing . 
" i'm italian , don't you understand ? " amelio's film is a political one , with a black comedic edge to it , as it traces the tragic recent history of albania , studying the dehumanizing effect bad governments have on its people . italy was flooded with a wave of albanian immigrants , looking to that country to fulfill its utopian dreams because of its material and cultural strength , but italy could not handle the onslaught of so many people , and would not let anymore immigrants in . this is a rather slow-moving film , that is chocked full of themes and universal messages the director feels impelled to get across . whether it is worthwhile or not to have a film be so politically motivated that it fails to be entertaining , is up to you to decide . the political aims seem necessary to see and understand for the viewer , the reward comes in images that stick with you long after viewing the film . therefore , this becomes a special film , not necessarily a better film , but one that is made beneficial for those who are interested enough to stick with this film's slow pace and all the political explorations that are needed to show how corrupt and decaying albania really is and how cherished the human spirit is , sometimes able to survive on the barest evidence of hope . amelio ( open doors , stolen children ) has so much political ground to cover that the film becomes overwhelmed with the misery of its exploration and suffers because of it . problems such as immigration , poverty , corruption , cultural decadence , ignorance , hate , greed , and a generation influenced by italian television are just too complicated and heavy to handle without sacrificing something in the process . what is sacrificed , is that , though i liked what i saw , i did not feel passionately about it . it was a cold but intellectually sound effort . the heart of the film lies in the change that overcomes gino . this nightmarish episode in his life is certainly profound and deadly . and that is the success of this film . we are forced into seeing the poverty that exists there , and even if we don't like to be put in that position , there is nothing that we can do about it . there are just no answers , and the film is left without a happy ending , only a few images of hope . 
it is allegedly based upon a true story , one that echoes the director's universal appeal for everyone to end all their hatred . the bitter war , seems almost to be inevitable in this over two hour film , told in a detached style , emphasizing the bloody battles , as it clearly shows how war is both hell and insanity . if the film could be faulted , it is that everyone in it is used as a symbol , which takes away some of the spontaneity of their individualism , so the characters don't really stick with us as much as the arson of the villages does and all the other catastrophes that result from the war . this is a disturbing film , not one that is easy to watch , even as its gallows humor tries to lessen the somber tone of the story . 
now that doesn't sound too radical , or does it ? nevertheless , the church has not recognized that work and in 1945 declared the work to be a heresy . that is the filmmaker's version , but he's mistaken , it was not declared heretical : upon further research i discovered that the church only said it was simply non-canonical . as for it being unattainable and suppressed by the church , that's hogwash , i've owned a copy of it since the 1970s and anyone can order it in a bookstore . that the film doesn't always stick to its aim and gets mired down in unnecessary subplots , is what disappointed me most about this story that could have been . . . well , great ! that is , if it were in the hands of a filmmaker who was more accurate in his details . the film uses the supernatural as its storyline . this very revealing statement of how inaccurate all the christian icons are magnifies the point the filmmaker is making , that even the eyewitnesses to the event all saw things their own way and to dogmatize them without questioning them , makes for a very questionable religion . director wainright tries hard to make stigmata to be an unconventional film , with a " hip " musical score ( smashing pumpkins ) and a mod style of camera shots and montages . by using many different fanciful camera angles , he allows you to feel the pain of the crucifixion while we see nails driven into frankie's wrists . there are many other disturbing images , such as broken glass moved by a spiritual wind , doves appearing out of nowhere , ominous bird feathers , and dripping blood , which add , unfortunately , to the incredibility of the story . during the sequences in which frankie receives her wounds , there are a number of quick cuts between her body in agony and a crucified male , and many slow motion shots emphasizing the agony over and over again . the dazzling cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of pittsburgh look like an inferno , while it switches gears and goes to the contrasting opulence of the vatican and the poverty of the brazil village , where the faithful flock to the miracle church . though there are many films ( exorcist , rosemary's baby , omen ) trying their hand in this supernatural and religious thriller genre , this film tries a somewhat different look to it ( but those demon voices coming out of frankie , sure sounded like linda blair's possessed voice in the exorcist ) . some of the things the filmmaker tried to do can certainly be questioned as to their effectiveness , especially the over-the-top special effects ( especially weak was the fire during the closing scene , it was overwrought with symbolism and inaccuracies ) and , what might even be a worst cheapening of the film , was the romantic suggestions between the handsome priest and the troubled girl who just wanted to get her life back and " loves being me . " in my opinion , these were distractions to an already complicated story , a story if it is to be taken seriously has to remain focused on what it was aiming for and not try to tell more of the corruptions in the catholic church than it could handle . the romantic hints between the two were fine to a certain extent , it made the point that a priest's disavowal of sex has its complications just like sex does for ordinary people . but when it went for overkill and tried to show how human the priest was , that he was more affected by saving the girl's life and giving her love than he was in preserving church dogma , i just thought it became too cheesy to show him in bed with her and ogling her like he was in love with her , that , for me , was going over the top . i have no idea where the director was trying to go with that . it just opened the film up for unnecessary criticism , and i wanted this film to succeed without those kind of distractions because i thought it was onto something . what it had to say was a rational response to such an authoritarian institution that cannot readily accept challenges from within or without . i don't see the story as an anti-religious film , as much as i saw it as a challenge to having one way of looking at religion . in order to challenge the church , there is no doubt that feathers have to be ruffled , but as i saw the film , the catholic community was mostly treated with respect and the essential need for religion was never in question . it is only from the film's ogre , sneeringly played by jonathan pryce , that we see a one-dimensional predictable performance . he is evil from- the beginning to the end- of the film , and how he ends up is just hollywood hokum , leaving me disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the cardinal look like a strangler . wainwright should have had enough convictions in the strong ideas he presented about his kind of religion being a personal one and should have let the quick lesson he gave us on how the church examines miracles , to be enough of a case against the church and let it go at that . i was mostly impressed with gabriel byrne as a priest . his low-key approach to this role was the glue that held the film together and made it possible for non-believers such as me , to believe that there was some faint hope for the church to actually be spiritual in a universal and unbiased sense . i just couldn't warm up to her sexy dumb hairdresser characterization , it seemed too funky and since she was the brunt of most of the special effects , it all seemed like an exorcist movie going on for too long , losing any rationality and prospective of what this film was supposed to be about . depending on what you are looking for when you view this movie , is what kind of reaction you should have to it . if you view it as a horror movie , then you are in for a big disappointment . this film is more silly than scary , and less funny than risible . but if you look upon it as a challenging religious conspiratory film , the way i saw it , a film that examines the past power structure of the church and the power that the church has today , then you might see a film that is more interesting than you would be led to believe by the way it was advertised and by the way some critics felt that it was their duty to defend the " poor " catholic church from such an attack . in any case , i thought the film was not anti- religious , just critical of churchly abuses , which makes it a disturbing film in some circles . in my opinion , despite all its faults , the film is still a thinking man's film . that the church has blindly protested the movie , is of no concern to me . the filmmakers have not disavowed the institution of the church or belief in a god , but just question its search for truth . the film raised some serious questions that should be answered by the church . this film should be seen as an opportunity for the church to see what those who are critical of it are saying and they should not be afraid of the truth , even if it means they have to change . it is easy to lose track that this film is a serious one , despite the mtv feel the movie has to it , and that is what surprised me more than anything else about it . but what makes it fascinating , is why the filmmaker thinks the church can be toppled by this new gospel . in the past the church has always been able to be astute and co-opt anything it gets its hands on , for its own benefit . a better film would have veered away from the sensational and stuck to the nuts and bolts of its argument . but with that being said , it is interesting to hear what the director rupert wainwright says , `it was our goal to present this story as an unbelievable , yet wholly possible phenomenon , ' and like it or not that's what the film does . 
there's something about mary is a very funny film ; it makes the most out of being politically incorrect , profane , obnoxious , and settling for an unsophististicated juvenile humor to tide itself over while the romantic side of its tale fizzles . it makes fun of the retarded , abuses a pet dog to a point of near death , and makes no apology for being so crude . there are many other things that the film does wrong , but the bottom line is that it is funny in a way that is not mean-spirited . if the film could be faulted , it is because it runs too long and seemed sluggish at times , and the romantic tale was pointless . it is funny because it is so grossly done that , at first , it is hard to believe how far this tasteless gag is going , but it is taken to the hilt , as the police and fire departments arrive and the neighborhood gets to see an unusual occurrence , it even ends with the showing of the wounded private part . that will become the running gag for the remainder of the movie . but , he is so crude , that even though he knows exactly what she wants , he still blows it but acting like a jerk . what didn't work was how stupid and low the comedy had to go to get its laughs and the whole romantic scene , that without the comedy would have been a tedious watch . this raunchy comedy , created by the farrelly brothers , who gave us dumb and dumber and kingpin , is a winner only for those who don't mind being grossed out . i must confess , i laughed a lot during the film , but i wasn't completely won over with so much comedy that depended on making fun of someone else's problems . it made the romantic part of the romantic/comedy seem unneeded . . . as a nice added touch , the film had a singing troubadour , jonathan richman , appearing throughout the film in various settings to sing about mary and what makes her so special . 
a minor but most enjoyable tongue-in-cheek hitchcockian-like spy thriller from the michael powell & emeric pressburger team . the brisk pace of the film and its touches of quaintness , made the film seem very comically endearing inspite of the lack of any character study and the one-dimensional tone of the villains . the likable lovers , also , starred in powell's the spy in black . . . it was strange to see veidt in a romantic hero role , and even though he is such a fine actor , i prefer him in villain roles and wonder how much better a more romantically inclined hero would have fared in that role . 
penny , like the audience , gets used to these freaks and begins to see them as very gentle and touching human beings , and her heart , not her sex , goes out to them . at this point , the story could have gone in a number of directions , there were just so many themes it touched on , but chooses not to sensationalize its tale , instead it becomes a very sobering tear-jerker . though there were some moments for levity , as when blake tells penny , " maybe i'll see you when i'm single , " the film , nevertheless , remains too sober for its own good . but all they see at this party are people who are less normal than they are . they have a few more contacts with worldly people , with mixed results . the symbolism here , is that even if religion means well , it still does the wrong thing even when doing the right thing . so it is not surprising that they are very effective and convincing in their peculiar roles . the female part of their menage a trois , was played energetically by michele hicks , but was a somewhat less believable role than the twins . the whore with a heart of gold is already a staple of film lore and she brings nothing new to the table with this performance . her acting contrasted between being particularly touching to being strident and , at times , she was not very accomplished in her part . the other characters and especially the mother , had either too small a part to have an impact ; or , were not developed at all . the intensity of the film and its haunting nature worked to its benefit , as it made us see the twins as they are ; the film pulled no punches and stuck to the compelling nature of its subject matter . but these same advantages also worked to the detriment of the film , as the story was , at times , tiresome and rife with too much territory in which to go for all the problems it came up with . the film couldn't free itself from all the pain entailed in the three characters , and kept making the story more and more muddled . an example of that , would be the film's ending , where penny encounters the now single blake and possible romance is hinted at , but the story just seems to be warming up as it ends on such an unclear note . this original film had too many flaws in its storytelling and never became an inspiring drama or an entertaining work . it should be commended for its mesmerizing style and enormous strength it showed in sticking with an unpleasant subject most films do not usually cover . the brothers had something to say , but perhaps it was too much for them to say in one film , even in a film with a perfectly eerie cinematography to match its storyline . it is a film that has its heart , seemingly , in the right place ; it , nevertheless , missed the boat on telling the sexual story it promised but never delivered . a prostitute not having sex with a client who requested it is hard story to forget so easily , as it seems , if done right , that could have been an innovative and moving scene and helped the film recover from being too bleak . the film got caught up too much in the tragedy of the twin's life and dwelt too much on the gravity of their situation without coming up with much more than heavy symbolism for its answers ( chopsticks broken in half , a two dollar bill as change in a cab and later on the subject of a lecture by the good doctor telling how if the bill is torn in half it is not worth as much as if it were whole ) . i found those explanations to be too trite , and since i was never fully convinced that this wasn't a manipulative film , playing on the freakish nature of the brothers even if not sensationalizing it , i left the theater not fully satisfied with all of the storyline . 
probably the best of the charlie chan's starring the swedish born warner oland in the feature role . this film is distinguished by oscar levant creating an opera for it called carnival and william kernell doing the libretto . charlie is played with a subtle grace and aplomb by oland , giving the film its life-force . the film had a convincing atmosphere and style about it , and it had the peerless boris doing his chilling loony thing with great relish . but let's forget the story , this film is fun in an old-fashioned way , and it's many pearls of wisdom that come forth , such as charlie explaining how a madman and a genius are sometimes similar because they both live in a world created by their ego . now how can you beat that for hollywood's oriental-style of profundity ! 
monument ave . what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood . the film is seen through the eyes of bobby , the film's low-life protagonist . we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots . that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to . it all seems so pointless . monument ave . works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there . when they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous neighborhood adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up , it all seems to be a tragically wasteful way of life . even with all their bravado , they feel and act like losers . as the message is simply , that nothing changes here . 
my life so far is cute , it has an angelic glow to it ; it captures the gorgeous scenery of the argyll countryside and the mannerisms of the eccentric well-to-do pettigrew family . all the performances are first-rate , its storytelling and sense of drama are done in a classy manner , but it is a film that i quickly forgot about when leaving the theater , though i did have a smile on my face . and i say the following in a kindly manner , this is masterpiece theater stuff , appropriately filmed for the mature audience that should appreciate such a blithe period piece . the comedy comes easily in this lush story , as there are the old-film standby gags for comedy : featuring friendly dogs and an adorable kid . the darkest character in the film is the bible toting edward . he is a most perplexing character , wavering between moods of being absolutely charming , to those of being repugnant . it should suit even more than it does me , those who like their art to be " nice and mild . " 
the audience is not told what that question was , except that one student says , as he recovers one of the many paper planes flown with the same question written on it , " it's corny . " in truth , those comments crossed my mind about many aspects of this film , as i waivered about my feelings toward the story , as spellbinding as the overall film was , because the story , in parts , did feel " corny . " medem makes a symbolic point about relating the children's lives to a circle , where there is no real ending or beginning to their story . there are several other symbolic devices that are used by medem a bit more obtusely ( like empty gas tanks ) , and one of those images might even be considered prophetic , the repeated image shown of a car stopping short of a collision with a red bus . the solid story is befuddled with versions showing how the imagination of the two differs from the supposed reality of the story , which should leave the audience scratching their heads to try and figure out what is actually happening . the story stretches the coincidences to a point of incredibility and becomes more tainted with its philosophical message than a typical romance film usually is , as medem carries out the argument that both reality and fiction can be likened to a series of circles that interconnect through the efforts of coincidences that may not make sense to our mortal eyes , but these circles are present , in either physical places or in events taking place in one's life . as you might suspect by now , this film is not going to be clearly resolved . why should it be at this point , it has teased the audience from the opening scene onward and there is no reason why the ending shouldn't also be speculative . though , even in this type of traditional hollywood ending that has pleased movie goers of romantic films for generations now , the director has his doubts if there is any state of being that can be permanent . in the final shot , there is a picture of otto in her eyes . which one is the true version probably doesn't matter , as the director will allow you to believe whatever you want to . if you are interested in my guess , it would be the later version , the story seems to flow in that direction . most people i know , were put off by this slick ending , and question the filmmaker's real intentions for playing with the audience like this . as for me , it wasn't the ending that bothered me about this breathlessly beautiful film , with its stunning shot of the midnight sun and of the arctic wildlands , as much as the story getting lost in trying to be too fanciful , playing with my expectations for things to work out for these amenable lovers and then not delivering any firm message but what seems to be at first glance , only , a pretentiously philosophical one . and , by not staying on target with the romantic part of the story , but drifting around in circles , where the coincidences are just too much for any two people to experience in a lifetime , the film becomes marginalized and makes it seem like a philosophy exercise , albeit an absorbing one , but one that is , nevertheless , less dramatic and more melodramatic than it should be . but what i found strangely pleasant about the film , was that even though i was somewhat put off by the tricks employed throughout the story , i still found myself caught up in the dynamics of the characters and how commonplace their lives were , that is , if you could discount all the chance encounters . this made me realize that it didn't matter if this film wasn't going to meet my expectations about what should be happening or if its philosophy was overtly too oblique ; the film had a special quality about it that got its message across despite being off target . victor hugo oliveira , as the teenage otto , twisted up inside by the strange love relationship he is going through , was delivering a sensitive performance , as this relationship was intriguing , dangerously close to being incestuous , but was one that was not clarified any further , to the detriment of the film but to no fault of the actor . therefore , the startling ending to the film became less important to comprehend , because the heart of the film wasn't explored as much as it should have been . the strangeness of this film , is that its haunting use of language and visuals to fill in the blanks for the characters , still overshadows its melodramatic story and keeps the pot boiling , even when you might think the film is skiing lumberingly uphill instead of gracefully downhill and is about to slip and slide downhill in a crackup . but that never happens because the film has a special elusive quality about it that original films seem to always have . thusly , i felt caught up in the film's magical spell despite the many reservations i had about the manipulations the director used , as he ultimately proved that he has weaved a tale about the darkened lovers and their near-misses and made it into a tale of haunting characterizations , leaving something mysterious about this intangible and intelligent film that held my undivided attention throughout . 
this makes for a different type of documentary , one with a less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch , as the varied contestants of different ages , sizes , genders , and races , each have their idea on what it takes for them to win . the thing they have most in common , is that they want the truck , the question is how much do they want it . he calls this event a human drama thing , rather than a contest . some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews , were the one's whose personalities stood out , whom we saw at different hours and in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions . angie learns that she didn't prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes disorientated , saying she doesn't think she would ever do it again , but she comes back next year and wins . what is magnanimous about the documentary , was that even though it could have gone for the cheap joke and made fun of these people , instead it takes them seriously and let's them explain in their own way why they are there . the filmmaker clearly saw that what the contestants were doing was fantastic and out of the ordinary already , so there was no need to embellish the story , and by keeping it simple , he succeeded in telling their story honestly and in a very human way . the result is a quirky , non-dramatic , human interest story about the need for texans to drive a pickup , as if it was their god given right to have one . and as benny said , " it is something to see people struggling to get what you want . i'll buy that . it's worth a look , reminding me a little bit of that sydney pollack film " they shoot horses , don't they , " but without the cheap sentimentality pollack threw into his film . it played , for me , more like a sports story that espn 2 would air , where the filmmaker didn't know who was going to win and many times focused on those who unexpectedly dropped out , and part of the lure of the film was choosing who you think will win . 
do you know this voice ? ( director : so begins a film that is more interested in studying the nature of someone who could commit such a crime and have it escalate to a murder than in keeping the film suspenseful by having the audience guess who did it . " why did i have to meet you , you are ruining my life ? " this is the pivotal scene of this b/w noir film , as hopta goes completely over the edge and cannot be looked upon any more as just a pathetic loser who keeps making mistakes . what keeps the film chilling , is dan duryea as the friendly next-door neighbor , who is so psychologically warped , yet doesn't overtly show it . 
blood , guts , bullets & octane ( director/writer : joe carnahan ; cinematography : john a . jimenez ; cast : joe carnahan ( sid french ) , dan leis ( bob melba ) , ken rudulph ( f . b . i . another tarantino look alike indie , filmed in thirteen days for $7 , 300 , and it sure gets its money's worth for the effort . the filmmaker has come up with a crime-thriller spoof done at a hyper-frenetic pace that is as good if not better than most hollywood high-budget action films of this type . but it went on for too long and the fun subsided and soon became grating just like a bad commercial . but the quick pace of the film kept things moving briskly and their use of quirky titled chapters to each little skit , kept the level of juvenile humor this film was imbued with at a bearable level . one such chapter was titled " coldblooded hotheads , " just to give you an idea at what the film was driving at . it's a vintage pontiac le mans burgundy convertible that will soon be dropped off to them and they will be paid $250 , 000 if they allow it to sit on the lot for two days without trying to sell it or even touch it . a number of preposterous twists come about , as the film winds its way to its final payoff , where we see suitcases filled with money being exchanged , cocaine lined up in the trunk in plastic baggies , all sorts of high-powered guns exhibited , and mysterious packets of blood . the immoral main characters end up talking about what is right and wrong with themselves and the world they live in , which adds a nice touch of absurdity to the already absurd story . the film had energy , a ready made metaphor in the pontiac and the used-car lot , a semi-plausible plot , some promise in the filmmaker's ability to tell a story , some choppy dialogue that could be amusing at times , and enough nerve from the actors who at times improvised and got by with it , as it looked better than a film school film , which is what it most reminded me of . it was not innovative enough to be a superior work , it needlessly displayed too much homage to other contemporary indies to make this film seem special . yet it was engaging and at times very funny . 
there should also be some nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation spots , for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when growing up or raising a family . the moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved accordingly by the parties affected , and so what happens in the film's mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance , as it is put forth in a way that worked out for the film's sake but might not have seemed correct for many a viewer , or at least , it was not important enough to be resolved by the film , even if that clash was supposedly the whole point of the film . the acting was convincing , the story had a nice feel to it , and it followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at that time . what the film lacked , was resolution . i thought that the fleeting affair she had with the long-haired sculptured adonis figure , certainly satisfied her sexual needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response , which left me believing that the liaison was the thing here , just like in those romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read , with nothing more to tax your mind . 
the story has a certain charm to it and a genuineness that shows through in the telling of the story , as it moves seamlessly from comedy into suspense , at the drop of a briefcase . nick veronis makes his debut as actor/writer/director in this very refreshing story . it's also a buddy movie and the buddies all have an affability of their own and seem like the sort of people you would see in real life and not on a hollywood set . the film offers many keen observations about how these young people react to the tight situation they are in , and it examines in an amusing way their life-style and esprit de corps , but the story keeps coming back to jimmy and how he is prepared to do anything to make his film , even if it means stepping on a few toes of some gangsters . this is an energetic film , it has lots of black comedy and incisive dialogue to recommend it to an audience appreciative of indie films . 
takeshi " beat " kitano is certainly a unique director , whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable , achieving auteur status . he has a fascination with gangsters , violence , and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way . his films are always visually startling , with a bevy of bizarre shots , and , so far , all his films have gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline . he is so fascinating to watch , that it is shame we couldn't see more of his lunacy ; instead , the supporting cast , funny as they are with their deadpan humor , nevertheless , they cannot carry the film , and kitano has chosen to center the film around them . fortunately , there are plenty of his usual visual treats in this film , that make the film seem special anyhow . kitano , also , relishes giving women roles that could be considered demeaning . though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner , that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage , and supposedly liking it and coming back for more , it still shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen . maybe he knows something i don't know . but there is never any romance in his films that amount to anything , and this film is no exception . this mindless act escalates on both sides , and , of course , it makes no sense . this is all casually done , as if this kind of mayhem was as natural as eating rice cakes . if there is any point to this story , and i am not sure there is , but the message here might be , that friends are needed to help you out , no one is immune from the insanity that is in the air , because according to kitano , insanity is catching . and , if taking a stand alone against many , you are in deep trouble . somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original in all aspects of filmmaking . so let me say bravo to the one time stand-up comedian who doesn't know how to make a safe film , and tip my eagle baseball hat to him , not only for hitting a home run , but showing that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by running past the man who was on base . a cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment , that is not for all tastes , naturally . incidently , the american title to the film , boiling point , is misleading : in japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score . 
the brilliant cinematography in this slasher thriller is what takes it out of the ordinary realm of such films and makes it into a diverting and more artistic venture . esteemed cult director , donald cammell ( performance/demon seed/the wild side ) , has never quite lived up to the potential he showed in the masterpiece he co-directed , " performance . " what is meant by the film's title , refers to an apache legend about those who look into the eye of violence close-up , which allows the mystical eye to have his eye on you . as a film about mysticism , it fails badly to materialize as anything but nonsense . for a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a character study , this is , nevertheless , a well-crafted visual spectacle , featuring an array of beautifully stylized color co-ordinated scenes and out-of-the-way shots , that have little to do with the story , but overall they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film to a tee . if it is the mystery story itself that you are looking for , i'm afraid you will be disappointed , as it adds up to nothing much . but in those visual shots . . . it might disappoint some , who think cammell could have made something more than a slasher film ; but , then again , his strength is through his eye , no matter how distorted it may be , and even in this low-rent type of film , his images remain strong and his themes have a strange complexity about them , enabling the film to be oddly effective , even when it shouldn't be . 
a very troubling film , regarding the crimes of martha beck and raymond fernandez , who were executed in 1951 . it offers a vivid picture of greed , vanity , and pure evil . this film differs from the former in its more gaudy and cartoonish style and careful camerawork taking note of the reflecting light patterns that surrounded the couple , and with a penchant for showing the troubled characters gazing into mirrors , as if they were looking for their lost souls . the grim nature of its story was made less austere by the film's black comedy , which was a staple of both films . as diabolical as this film was , in showing the couple to be moral degenerates with no conscience or redeeming qualities , the earlier film , the one i still prefer , takes a slightly different emphasis , holding a more cult-like look at the grotesque couple , while also showing them to be heartless weirdos without any redeeming qualities . this is match made in hell . the most important thing in nico's life is to look good . say that this cowardly couple has some psychological problems , is to say a mouthful . i think that little touch of vanity got weary after a while , and the director just made too much of it . it lost its humorous quality by then in the story . 
a melodramatic noir film , with location shots in the caribbean . why cormack doesn't leave , is what makes him a typical noir icon . 
this stuff is all hush-hush . gee ! by this time the major and barbara show a strong affection for each other , and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding of hands taking place , though there is one scene where she comes out of the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the major's attention . now this romance could be taken for a serious one . it seems that the major is the only one on the base who does any work . so , you see , the major is a very busy man . it now becomes obvious that the professor is involved in this mystery , and the fun part of the film begins , or some might think the film really goes out of whack from here on . but things are not that simple , the atomic plant malfunctions and can't be shut down , and to my delight , the creatures become visible because of the increase in atomic power in the nuclear plant . what's viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking everybody they see , killing all the people manning the nuclear plant . there are great special effects , using stop-motion animation to show the brains moving around ! as entertainment value , this film should hit the right spot : it's a screamer . as anything greater , the story made little sense . this is just another mutant b- flick that is missing most of its brain . 
offbeat suspense story , with some romance thrown in , is a fast-moving crime caper , taking place mostly in a library . it's a spirited film , with enough cheap freudian explanations about the forger and his associate to keep you in stitches with its freudianisms . sanders's typical suave and maniacal performance , plus the b&w noir-like lighting for the film , give it a mysterious look , and the many twists in the plot and its unusual location , make it a better- than- usual b-movie . 
the 81-year-old boris karloff's last completed feature film , could have and should have been better , as it suffers from a weakly-crafted script despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen favorites who are in it- that would be karloff as professor marshe , christopher lee as morley , and barbara steele as lavinia . though , it is still worth seeing because of its star attractions and its innovative psychedelic offerings to the horror genre . bob scoffs at the witch story and the idea of ghosts being around , saying he knows little about such things . but the professor replies in his noted serious karloff movie tone , " when the time comes , your skepticism might be only a fragile shield . " bob's conversations with the wheel-chaired bound professor are terse but highlight the film , as they are delivered with proper horror film affect . the film's not real frightening because there is a flatness to it ; but , it has its entertaining moments , and is a must see for karloff fans . 
if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing , beautiful set designs , fantastic colors , sex , witchcraft , and a fairy tale charm to it , then you will probably like this film , which is in many ways like flying down to rio . though , i was hoping it could be more like those jacques demy or jacques rivette musicals , exhibiting a little more substance . but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment , this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at . the little known director of this film , hails from venezuela , which gives this french film a very natural latin twist to its story and music . the this is all done as harmless and silly fun , much in the vein of a long list of hollywood and french musicals , films that i was never partial to . for what it's worth , this film is an entertaining and colorful spectacle , and with enough verve in it to make it seem inventive . 
this romantic comedy about the love life of comic book writers feels like a sitcom because that is what it basically is , not withstanding , that it pushes the envelope further out by having characters in it who are more sexually active than the usual sitcom . its story is also a bit more arresting . its strongest asset being the quick-witted and acidy dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to deliver those punch lines . in this scene we get a good dose of the ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they do . banky has a blast with this explanation . our hero is not a liberated hero , but it is his flaws that give him credibility . the film gives this a surprising psychological meaning . the chasing amy is a moral fable . this scene was not needed , as the story itself was simple enough to follow . we did not need a ready made explanation of the film from the director . not everything worked or made sense , but the characters and their problems seemed real . and , the dialogue hit the mark more often than not . this is smith's third film about the travails of young people growing up in new jersey and influenced by " pop " culture . what i didn't like about the film , is that despite its attempts not to be viewed as a sitcom , that is what this film is , even if its mature story line adds more weight to it . sitcoms are just not the way i like to see drama unfolding , as it always leaves me thinking that things are still being dumbed down , that even though , these are characters we usually do not see on the screen and it is refreshing to see them ; we are , nevertheless , not going any deeper psychologically with this story and with character portrayal than other sitcoms go . smith's film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the struggle it takes to make it work , but there is still an air of superficiality about its presentation . 
the film's major fault is that it is too stagy a production . he is weird , slow-witted and obnoxious , but he does not have the same kind of depraved sexual relationship with parker as josh does . she is cute but not too swift , and is as straight as an arrow . i found tori's performance to be lacking in spunk , especially when compared to the fine ensemble cast she is surrounded by . how much you like this film depends on your idea of comedy and how much tolerance you have for " sick humor . " if this kind of parody over the tragedy that rocked the country , upsets you , and you think it is in bad taste , then you shouldn't see this film . if your reaction is like mine , then you will find that when this picture is on the mark , which is quite often , you will laugh aloud , and when it misses the mark , you might even wince . the real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an academic explanation for the parker character's obsession . it would have been better to have just ridden the comedy out and have been criticized by those who didn't like where the comedy was going . it seemed unnecessary to have changed the mood of the film and all of sudden offered some psychological explanations for jacki-o' behavior . the staple in the film was parker posey , the princess of the indie film . she , simply , steals the film . 
this film , based on carl sagan's novel , is a mixture of sci-fi , romance , sentimentality , and drama , brought to screen by the director of forreset gump . it relies on its ideas and its mild convictions to sustain its powerful but soppy story , rather than its special effects , contrary to many modern films that have just become special effect vehicles . governments seem to trust this type and like to put them in charge of things . attraction between them is overshadowed by idealogical differences , and nothing can get in the way of ellie's belief in evolution , not even this hunk who is a ridiculously loopy caricature of a religious zealot , one of those religious johnny-come-lately types . here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary aim-- that there is life in outer space . for these scenes , the film should have used the dictum from occam's razor : the simplest way to do something is the best way . as a sci-fi'er , with a good storyline that tends to get too schmaltzy , this film is up to par with those star wars films , but is outclassed by 2001 . sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion , but i don't think he would have been to happy with the elementary-school theological debate between the space pioneer and the government officials . i think the best answer a scientist could give in this scenario , was not given by jodi . . . but , a steven hawkings might have said that it is through these scientific machines that we will come closest to reading the mind of god . it is a thing of great beauty . at least , this is what my science friends tell me is the more typical attitude toward god in their community . 
his predilection is for most of his heroes to be deformed or have suffered heavily at the hands of another . the simplistic plot can be seen from a mile away as to how it will develop and turn out . it exhibits the kind of racist outlook shown to the natives that movies will not allow today . what distinguishes this film , is the virtuoso performance of chaney as a villain , as he transforms himself into a fearsome character , and his expressive face keeps changing with his different moods . he could be tender and fatherly at one moment and the next moment he could have a menacing look . he also has a flare for wearing just the right makeup for the part he plays ; here he looks almost bald , giving him the extra chilling look he needed to have for the part . his speciality in the grotesque made him a silent star icon , someone who will not be forgotten , who could get the audience's attention by either inspiring them with the vulnerability of his character or by his morbid sense of getting into his character . the film is a strangely curious relic , not because of the story , but because he played this legless man so convincingly . 
i'm not a fan of glam rock , my musical partialities are more in the line for classical music or '60s rock . glam is the kind of music that is pretty to look at for short periods of time but when more closely scrutinized could turn ugly . that is both the virtue and problem with this entertaining and stylish celebration of the rock music scene by todd haynes ( safe/poison ) , that has the right musical feel but offers no depth and little character development in its story . this fictionalized story is a thin disguise for david bowie's bio , and it was able along the way to rip-off the citizen kane way of telling a biography in a fictionalized way . and if that weren't enough of a splash in the water of cause c ? l ? bre , haynes throws a bit of the oscar wilde biography into the fiction presented . the film works best as a music video and if you like the music , you'll probably love the film . as a film it was a colorful spectacle , wonderfully performed , very energetic , and it had some witty dialogue ; but , it failed to tell a cohesive story and failed to capture what that period of the 1970s was about . it was hard to tell what haynes was trying to expose or tell about this fictionalized bowie-ziggy stardust-like character . it was all vague and superficial , i suppose , just like glamor is . besides , i don't really know how worthwhile it is to uncover his mystery life-like who cares ! anyway , he wasn't made into an interesting character by slade's characterization of him-i think david bowie is a much more interesting character than brian slade . if you don't mind having an empty feeling after seeing a film , then this one could be your kind of nourishment . the suggestion made was that these performers are role models and influence many teens-for good or bad . unfortunately , the film did not pick up on that thread of the story , as it continued on in its glitzy musical style . curt , " if you don't look at the world . " i guess something must have happened to the two performing artists along the way , but it must have happened offscreen , because it didn't happen onscreen . 
two things could be said for sure about this movie , which uses mostly nonprofessional actors , that it is disturbingly romantic and it is troublingly inconclusive . there is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story , but the visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully explored in an original way , by the first-time director , manuel pradal . metaphors abound in this film , so much so that one could overdose on all the heavily intended poetical images and still not find much to sate one's hunger for what this film is ultimately about , which becomes the film's major fault . if you want something that is predictable about this unpredictable film , you have it here , you can bet your popcorn money that before the film is over some innocent kid will get it . if you want to read some politics into this film , you might say that the director was using the local american navy base as a metaphor , showing the mixed-reaction it gets from the locals , as he tried to get at what the local reactions to the base are by showing that there is an undercurrent of disrespect and lack of trust for each other . the mystery about them , gives them a camus-like sense of existentialism , it is as if the more modern the story tries to be , the more it can be seen rooted in an old philosophy , a philosophy of fatalism . the beauty in the film is from the never stopping camerawork , picking up one beautiful scene after another , though what connection this all has to do with the movie is anyone's guess . as i thought this film was about loners versus the group psychology prevailing , whereas the loners can't function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls can find no place in modern french society to fit in . the trouble with that pat explanation of the film , is that the film doesn't help itself any by overloading the imagery , so that if one wanted to , there could by many other explanations for what the film was about . after a certain point , that becomes an annoying feature of the film , as the two teens lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director was trying to say . this is possible because of there persistent silence and lack of character development . aside from being a stunning film to watch , i could see no beauty in its dark character portrayal of the lovers and the film's overall pessimistic attitudes toward youth . the film had too many missing ingredients in it for it to be impactful ; i could hardly remember the main characters just a week later after seeing the film , only remembering how alluring vahina giocante was and how beautiful the south of france looks . 
the problem with the film , as an original and diverting story as it is , is that it is also too confusing to follow and suffers from a sense that it is too " hip " for its own good . but even as the film failed to add up to being as good as it could have been , it was still entertaining and visually engaging . i began to enjoy the film more for its style , which is the only way to view it . it was shot in such exacting detail , its colorful sets becoming a feast for the eyes that were ready to experience visions not seen in other sci-fi films , it also allowed for a certain pleasure to be induced from overhearing the odd conversations that were inane but fun to listen to . fox's haiku is a good example of the meaningful nonsense the film conveyed , as he recites to x the poem he just wrote : but something mysterious soon happens and the last 20 minutes of the film repeats what happened so far , but adding new details and a different way of looking at it . the murky ending will not be pleasing to most viewers , as they try to make sense of what is happening . 
its pulse is taken out of the shock stories that appear daily in the newspapers . sitko's classical noir line to him is , " you going legitimate is like a vulture turning vegetarian . " the once typical crime story from hollywood has now taken a more forlorn look at how people really are . fake niceties are not allowed in this highly charged atmospheric b&w film . sitko has no vices such as the bottle , womanizing , and gambling . he's about as clean-cut as a noir protagonist gets in these sort of films . the only thing that keeps him noir , is his cynicism and willingness to do anything to get what he wants . the ones who imbue the film with its usual noir credentials are the heavies : burr , whose only thought about being involved with murder was , " i should have stuck to blackmail and petty larceny . " 
these scenes between the cops and the hysterical youth are classic noir ones and are what give the film its very dark edge . this was a dark tale and could have been made more interesting if it cut away from father roth's saintly but unconvincing role and followed through more on the story as it was written by philip yordan from leo brady's novel . the potential was there for a great film . censorship was the curse of the 1950s for films , and this good priest-bad priest part of the story unfortunately turns out to be an exercise in self-righteousness , unwisely tacked onto a perfectly good story . 
warner bros . could crank-out smashing suspense films like this one on a regular basis during the 1940s . the film was faithfully adapted from the novel of british author , eric ambler , and had more of a european feel to it than the ordinary american noir , though because of the dark lighting and the shadowy photography of renown film cinematographer arthur edeson- he also did " the maltese falcon , " the film was able to retain its noir credentials despite lacking the usual cynicism of noir . the film uses flashback to tell the story . when peters gets the money , he is gleeful for the moment , as the money is photographed as looking huge onscreen , looking more like monopoly money than real . he adds as the film dissolves : " you see , there's not enough kindness in the world . " rich flavor in the film comes from the lead character actors , who are indescribably witty and tacky , displaying good chemistry in working with each other , whose characterizations are most striking . they , along with the strong performance by scott , give this pleasant thriller the life it needs to sustain it . the story itself , is too superficial to be anything more than a b type of programmer . but the film had a certain style to it that more than made up for the awkward telling of the story's ending . 
a minor noir film , originally made for radio . vince tells him i grew up with you , we took a lot of raps together , and then you turned stool pigeon on me , turning state evidence on me so that you could beat the rap , making me serve a two year sentence for manslaughter . " i should call dr . kemble ! " but kemble is not available . the film's finale is done in grand noir-style , filmed in a santa monica warehouse , where one of vince's flunkies , petey , played by the rotund , minuscule veteran character actor with the high-pitched squeaky voice , percy helton , my all-time favorite bit player , who must have had thousands of uncredited parts in a variety of films . what distinguishes this film as not the normal crime-type of film , with a happy ending , but as a noir-work , is how it captures the changing societal attititudes of the protagonists , who desperately want to fit into postwar american society despite their prior misdeeds . this is seen mainly through the dark los angeles settings depicted by the camerawork of probably the best noir cinematographer ever , john alton , and not through the thin plot structure of the film . what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer , is the warehouse shootout , as we see these antisocial types trapped like rats and how they react . it all seems credible because john payne has the look of someone who has just come out of a laundry washing machine and is now being hung out to dry . 
a vulgar mockumentary about a jewish-italian wedding , whose detractions are that some of the scenes could have been better edited , the jokes being rather lame , and the script being too threadbare . everyone in the film is a zany , as each character does their own comedy schtick . there is profanity used throughout the film and at the most surprising times , like when the groom's father ( vella ) is giving a toast . he says italians have little self-control when it comes to women , so he doesn't expect his son to remain loyal , even though he should because lisa's a nice girl . the film opens with a quote by h . l . mencken : " marriage is a worthwhile institution , but would you want to live the rest of your life in an institution ! " at least , one ethnic group is not treated any worse than the other . lisa has a great smile and a star quality about her , she brings comedy and warmth to the role ; she even gets a chance to sing . the cast was likable but not memorable , but for a film with a limited budget and limited aims , it served its purpose adequately . it was funny from beginning to end , but in a perverse way . this lighthearted farce , is not suited for all tastes . 
jacques demy , the subject of this biography , was a great filmmaker ; his films were poetical visions , filled with music and fantasy and magic . the french director was most acclaimed for his inventive 1964 musical " the umbrellas of cherbourg . " the pivotal point of the film revolves around his use of imagination and how he was always inspired by it . vargas , by showing the " inspirational " episode from his childhood and then his usage of it in films such as , " lola , " " the umbrellas of cherbourg , " " the young girls of rochefort , " " donkey skin , " or some other demy work , has managed to tie the director's early life into his life in films . scenes like that come off as being truly genuine . but for all the niceties about him shown , and deservedly so , this biography seemed somewhat sterile and unwilling to question a lot of personal things about demy's life . it seemed to be bent on being an homage and final goodbye , without the benefit of being anything more critical . the film seems as if it was a guided museum tour given to elementary school children , that will only show the director's dedication to being a filmmaker and will reveal nothing about what is inside the man . this film should inspire others to follow their own beliefs , but does not have the magical qualities of a demy film . 
is presented onscreen is an intelligent but somber look at how the three main characters cope with their uneven lives and manage to act so civilized when feeling so much pain at finding their lives to be unresolved . the film is a constant flux between flashbacks and what is current . we first see bendrix at his typewriter , writing about hatred . he plays the role romantically , in an old-fashioned manner , exhibiting a relish for the role . julianne moore evoked a special passion to her role , she was able to mix the fire in her with the serenity , making her performance a sublime one . the film works mainly because of her . that is why it was essential to film so many of their scenes over again , to witness how each viewed the same experience they were having . the problem with that , is the film seemed to move at a snail's pace , and had too much of a vacuum between its intellectual messages and heavily passionate scenes . overall , it was a rather dull film , despite the fine performances , the intelligence of the story , the able direction , and the beautiful cinematography . though what's astonishing about jordan's direction , is the mood the film sets , being so nostalgic and intimidating , as if daring the viewer to believe that this old-fashioned kind of genteel love story could also be so daring in its passions , and challenging in its arguments about jealousy , carnal love , and religious faith . this is all aided by the splendidly vivid images and the expressive language of the sensitive lovers trying to express their inner feelings . it is through greene's own words , where he relates how much more difficult it is to talk and write about happiness than it is about pain , that one can understand how the moore role is most likely to be believed only by a true believer , that words are inadequate to relate the joy she felt . the film , as well-conceived as it was , was still too laborious of a process . i think the story would have had more tension to it , if henry wasn't such a wimp and put up some kind of fight for his wife . 
this is more of a message film than a noir thriller , but has been classified by most cinefiles in the noir category . brooks's novel broached the subject of a civilian getting killed by a soldier because he was a homosexual , but the breen office that acted as a censor for hollywood , would never allow that topic . so the filmmakers made the bias crime to be against a jew , which also was a subject hollywood tried to avoid , but , perhaps , because of the holocaust , it was allowed to be presented onscreen by the censor . coincidentally , in the same year , another film on the same subject , " gentleman's agreement , " appeared , which confined the anti-semitism to social situations . this b film , considered an experimental film , was budgeted for five hundred thousand dollars and shot in 20 days , and spent most of its budget on its star cast , and was rewarded with a box office success and a critically acclaimed hit . he had read brooks' novel and liked the book so much that he asked brooks , also a marine , to keep him in mind for the part of monty if the book ever gets made into a movie . the racial slur jewboy is used by monty , which emphasises how this is solely a hate crime . crossfire becomes more of a film about anti-semitism than it does a murder investigation , especially since there is no real mystery as to who did the killing . the script was stale , the acting was wooden by everyone but ryan . there isn't one character that doesn't speak in cliches except for ryan , and not a one has any individual depth . his original role was censored by the breen office . they felt it wouldn't look good to see soldiers frequenting a prostitute . what this film should be commended for , is that it brought to the public's attention that anti-semitism can also be the subject of a film . hollywood films have a history of staying away from controversial subjects and this b film did what other films didn't at the time . it is further interesting to observe , how this film got the ire of senator mccarthy and his witch hunters . under pressure from the censors , the filmmakers weren't allowed to explore any further the depths of anti-semitism . it should , also , be noted that both dmytryk and paxton received oscar nominations . the censors demanded that it is not in the best interest of the war department to show the soldiers drinking anything but coffee . even though the filmmakers were forced by the breen office to bend over backwards to make their film a safe one , it still was able to show the bias present in america and how serious a problem it was . it would have been a much better film if it weren't for the censor : there is absolutely no question about that . 
the film is not a touristy tale ; it is based on irish folklore . the main problem it has , is that the story gets bogged down on unnecessary subplots , which make it difficult to focus entirely on the main story . rea is equally as good , in a role that is a take-off on the frenetic crazie eddie character who years ago was seen hawking goods on american tv . the landscape reflected the hard life of its denizens . a very scornful look at what some will do to get what they want or think they want . it is worth seeing for the tremendous performances and a bit of the gritty local flavor not usually seen about a film emanating from ireland . 
in the end , it becomes indulgent and ties things up much too neatly to be taken seriously as drama . it is a familiar story , but told with great charm here and with sharp observations of how these academia types talk to each other and interact . the theme of " wonder boys " -- is conventional -- it is about the author's self-development . the script is snappy , the actors are pleasing to behold , the photography , mostly shots of pittsburgh in the midst of snow or a torrential downpour , is bleak-- but it interestingly sets the tone for the film's playful story . the idea for the film was a good one , but something gets stuck here , preventing the film from taking a chance and becoming a bold story , one that it could have easily become if it made that choice and knew what to edit and what to add . also dragged into the story are an interracial couple who add some slapstick scenes , enlarging the quirky flavor of the film . those scenes were amusing in the way those old-fashioned comedies of the 1930s and 1940s were . the film had a warm and fuzzy feeling to it . it had some good bob dylan tunes in the background . it was a return to liberalism movie , bucking a trend of a lot of new films to be more conservative or more extreme in their unconventionality . in any case , it was good to see a film about some older people with a sense of humor , a bit of romance in them , who are able to loosen up a bit . this does not make it a great film , but it was diverting and had a certain sophistication to it that should attract an older audience , one more perceptive about the advantages of a higher education . to the film's credit , it keeps its focus on tripp as someone who is mixed-up , but who is still trying to be a decent teacher and help those under his tutelage . 
this irish crime charmer has 'the gift of gab . ' it's a shaggy-dog type of story , filled with colorful characters and the color of the irish countryside . the film should be valued for its amusing dialogue , despite the difficulty to understand what is being said because of the thick brogues . maybe , he's just a good guy , or a bit naive , or perhaps he is a bit short on smarts . it is mostly a road movie , showing what it's like to bring frank back to dublin . there are a lot of sudden twists in the story that keep you guessing as to what happens next . the violent conclusion is done with style and adds to the comic mood the film set . it is a rather cheerful film-- despite the violence , the lowlife characters , and all the peat bogs the duo come across . it also has something to say about being loyal as opposed to being greedy . its ethics are blurred by what society considers right and wrong , but by going over that line of decency , the film gains most of its charm . 
the film has its rewarding moments to counter its muddled attempt to cover what actually happened . but spike is not that concerned with the serial killer , his perspective of the event is how it influenced an italian bronx neighborhood , bringing out its paranoia . the most interesting character in the film is not david berkowitz , but vinny ( leguizamo ) from the bronx , a hairdresser , someone of a working-class mentality and someone who is possessed with a weak character . it was at times a film that bordered on greatness , but then for long stretches turned back into a mess , filled with untenable stereotypes of the italians , while losing track of its story about the psycho . . 44-caliber michael badalucco's characterization added nothing to the story except disappointment that his character wasn't even attempted to be explored . it's a messy film , moving in many different directions , but it is filled with ideas and is always engaging . the lead performers leguizamo , brody , esposito , sorvino , and rispoli give crisp performances . leguizamo's performance is special in a visceral way , it exposes his double-standard life and his lowlife mindset , his rage is what the film keys in on . the film doesn't really come to a climax or say anything new about society at large , but it has an excitement of its own that is grandiose . that's about as complimentary as i can get about a film that should be praised more than it should be lambasted for its faults . it should be praised for showing how scared people are of those who are different and how they need to blame someone for what they don't understand . the scene near the end of the film was particularly violent and revolting , giving the film the jolt it needed to make its case about those who are narrow minded . this was not a film , after all , about the killer , its victims , or about the summer of 1977 , it was a film about those who were victimized because they are made into scapegoats for someone else's problems that they can't face themselves . it is a film about urban white people of italian origin : their fears , their angers , their prejudices , their repressions , and their eroticisms . it almost seems as if the story about the son of sam was not even needed . this was a film almost exclusively about an italian neighborhood and their xenophobia , and it could have taking place in any year after 1950 . 
the charles dickens influence is evident on griffith's work , as the complications to this simple plot keeps getting more involved in the political trials of the revolutionary times . it also gave the director a chance to pontificate against the more current bolshevic revolution of 1917 . the popularity of the play inspired at least one french and three american film adaptations . it's not a film without major faults , which include stilted acting , clumsy characterizations , an implausible tale , and laughable melodrama . but somehow the well-intentioned sincerity of the story plows its way through the mess and the film is interesting as both a museum curio and for the raw emotions expressed by the suffering sisters . it is also noted for its rough characterization of robespierre , its beautiful costumes and authentic looking mob scenes , capturing the chaos of the times . but it still should prove to be of interest mainly to film buffs rather than the general public . he was someone who believed that if you didn't think like him , you were evil . the excessively melodramatic story is one that tugs at the heart strings , but makes up for so much goo by conveying griffith's history lesson : that the french revolutionists rightly overthrew a bad government , but unfortunately allowed dictatorial mob rule to take over . how the film works for you , depends on what you can overlook about it that is creaky and what you can accept about it that is grandiose . it has not aged well , but i found it worth seeing for its historical value and its chilling suspense . for whatever the director's faults were , as for his politics being tainted with contradictions , he , at least , always considered his art above all else . it is filmed in a pleasant to look at tinted b/w . 
so begins this gothic mystery , based on umberto eco's witty novel . for the monks , without fear there would be no reason to believe in god . the story is chaotically told , making it difficult to keep track of what exactly is happening . if only the telling of the story wasn't such a clumsy venture and the identity of the killer so easy to solve , this could have been a more enjoyable film . sean connery is charismatic and though an odd choice to play the lead , if you can suspend your disbelief in him as a book lover to the extreme , and see him more like a modern sleuth , then his characterization seems to be a humorous one . though , i still think this part would have been better served by someone who was a bit more quirky . he reminded me too much of his james bond persona , which was a definite clash with the medieval scenario he was placed in . but the weakness inherent in the film , is in the dullness of the characters ( looks aside ) and the story itself is bereft of the wit the author gave it in its printed word . when the powerful apocalyptic finale comes and the monastery is in flames , it is too late to save the film . just like william saved only a few valuable books from the fire , the viewer can cherish only a few scenes that were irresistible , and thereby may come away only somewhat satisfied . 
you get a film with a few subplots in it for the ticket price of one here . but you ultimately get what you pay for , and here the main story becomes tiring and the secondary story is oedipal and underplayed , and the other subplots are pointless , so what you really get is the main story being compromised by the subplots , which weakens the main story into a formula-driven one . the main story is a homage to the movie " wall street " and its message of greed but , at least , it comes without the moral piety of oliver stone . yet , he still stays with the firm , something the film couldn't really show why , even though they tried explaining it with a subplot of a ruptured father/son relationship . the story's other subplot is a frenetic tale of white men in their twenties with lots of testosterone to burn , who just want to be millionaires and don't care how they do it . the dialogue is schmaltzy and unconvincing ; their hard sell techniques are sleazy and leave the characters soulless , and the 'homeboy' attitudes displayed by their after-work hijinks- of pub crawling , looking for fights and girls , leaves a lot to be desired . father and son had a tension between them that made for some melodramatic moments . but this is clearly a film about young people with unbridled energy who are clueless about how to live their lives without copying someone else's idea of what the good life is . and because they are so dull-witted and deliver lines without the gift of gab that a writer like david mamet presents his stars with , in his glengarry glen ross , the film lags in scope . but through the device of quick-paced editing , it appears to be moving to some sort of rapid resolution . its moral theme might be , if you get rich so fast , you must be ready to fall quickly . the characters here are just low-level white collar hustlers , the amoral garden variety kind , and their distasteful conduct and empty lives spark no interest . these are the kind of telemarketers that the american public has been inundated with over the recent years , with no end in sight . since the film doesn't humanize them , but allows them to be the monsters they really are , it is indeed a hard sell to find this film as anything but a look at the ugly side of outlaw capitalism . the movie has a lot of energy and zeroes in on an unhealthy segment of the population whose lure for working is solely for material things , such as fancy cars , not giving a hoot how ethical their job is . its company name j . t . in the background hip-hop music blares away . this is a film geared for young people , its target audience is probably made up of those who liked last year's overrated nihilistic fight club . a romance is brought into the film as another subplot , but is never fully developed to be anything but superficial . she shuns greg and goes for his underling seth , in a romance that has about as much spark in it as a firecracker that fizzles out in your hand . why this interracial romance develops and how it suddenly ends , doesn't amount to hill or beans . the best thing about the film was the performance of vin diesel as chris , a seasoned hustler of stocks and bitter rival of greg's . there is a certain power in his character , a believability about what he is doing there that seemed more intense than seth's fall and redemption . the film would have been better off focusing in on his story ; it would have remained true to its cynical premise about the youth it features . this story is at best , about a theme that was done before in films such as " wall street " and " tin men , " but this time with even more cynicism and more of an edge to it . the picture itself is a hustle , trying to sell you something by pretending it has something to say , if you hold onto to its premise without selling it short . underneath the closeness of the boys in the boiler room , there are some underlying problems in their relationships besides the usual ones of competiveness . and chris shoots back , " why don't you go make me a latke , dreidel boy ? " interestingly enough , the only one in the firm that seth trusts is chris , and this trust is rewarded in a contrived scene in the end , as the film tries to dig itself out of the amoral hole it dug for itself . the operative word in this film is contrived . 
it did ruin the film to a certain extent , as it looked disjointed in parts and did not appear up to fuller's usually high standards of filmmaking . nevertheless , it resulted in a disturbing film about american morality that has something to say about hypocrisy and something modern to say about being an independent woman . the couple talk about byron's poetry and about venice being a special place for lovers , and everything seems too good to be true . for towers , the naked kiss is that of a pervert . for fuller , this film is a morality story , where honesty can't seem to exist within the law but only outside of it . the weakness in the film , is that it asks you to believe its flighty story without questioning it . but its moral premise is on solid footing . 
i think i've seen this film before : it's called pulp fiction . but that aside , this is a very funny crime caper , involving double-crosses , kidnappings , and outrageous shootouts . it is stylized noir-- meaning noir is no more to be taken seriously as in the post-ww11 noir films . it is now used by many directors as a spoof of the genre , as it is here , by the first-time woman director , jennifer leitzes . the film relies on its characters to make things happen , as the story really is too slight to do the complete job , of making montana bigger than the small state of mind it is . it was scenes like this , coming in flashes , that kept the film alive . stanley tucci is a marvelous actor and is a joy to watch here . kyra sedgwick works well with tucci and significantly adds to the farcical nature of the film . philip seymour hoffman never gives a bad performance ; here he is the creepy turncoat , a part he can do in his sleep by now . but he does it well . the high level of acting raises this ordinary film in stature , but does not make it into anything more than a highly entertaining and derivative film . 
raul ruiz , the chilean-born , france-based director of one hundred films so far , who has been noted for his offbeat features and ambiguous works , has made this american mainstream film in english that has all his pet themes intact . for a ruiz film , this one is about as accessible as he gets . if you ever wanted to know how it might feel for a person who is losing their marbles , this film might be able to shed some light on that . it is a tantalizing thriller that offers the viewer a chance to see if they can separate fantasy from reality . ruiz's films always seem to be about the multiple identities of characters who might just be figments of one's imagination or might be about someone who is leading a parallel life . shattered image has its two stars struggle through some very awkward dialogue and plot twists that keep coming unmercifully at the viewer . ruiz's experimental film style opts for the most he can get out of his stylized settings , confusing but beautiful camera shots , and all the kitsch he can muster in every mise-en-sc ? ne . but she can't determine what he looks like . the film's ending is as blurred as jessies' intermingled dreams are ; but , at least , the climax returns to the beginning of the film to try and clear things up in the usual unhelpful way ruiz solves his mysteries . if you enjoy this kind of pseudo intellectual puzzler , then you must be prepared to be kept in suspense , not knowing more about the character than what ruiz wanted revealed . 
a feel-good , old-fashioned ( except for all the cuss words ) , liberal message movie for the people and by the people , resulting in a populist film . it surprised me in how invigorating a performance there was from julia roberts ( she usually turns me off ) , and how there was such a good chemistry between her and the gruff albert finney . but , the subtle performance by the rumpled looking finney , playing second fiddle without a hint of a complaint , as his panned reactions to her antics made her star quality shine more brightly , was the key to the film's success . his role is a paper-thin one , as the sensitive , long-suffering lover . it reminds me of the role hollywood usually reserves for the sweet but simple lady co-star , who is just around to make the star look good . julia roberts's breasts are propped up and very noticeable , wearing tight-fitting clothes with low necklines , at all times . when told by the boss " you might want to rethink your wardrobe a little , " she retorts , " i think i look nice , and as long as i have one ass instead of two , i'll wear what i like . " the film was all about her . it plays pompously proud of itself like the do-gooder fare it is , with no real emotions shown for the victims , as it only shows the pain julia feels for them . this one's all about julia roberts , and if you buy into her for the part , you are more than likely to be pleased with the film . as for my reaction , i felt , what the hell , the utility company acted so maliciously evil and the outcome of the case is documented , so what i would not have accepted so readily from a drama , i found myself accepting in this political conscience film . where i saw the film , the same type of working-class clients of julia's , were in the audience and were laughing lustily at the jokes , and they seemed to enjoy seeing this big company being taking on by one of them . this mainstream film by steven soderbergh ( sex , lies and videotape/out of sight/the limey ) , is shot in a sitcom conventional style , without most of the director's usual artististic flourishes from his past films . there have been many hollywood films of this type , including , silkwood , a civil action , and norma rae , with this film somewhere in the middle of the entertainment scale when held in comparison . 
when don pedro agrees , serafin tells the audience that i am macoco . there are several surprises in the works and an outstanding dance number by the nicholas brothers . this highly entertaining film overcomes its stagy plot with some lively cole porter tunes , gorgeous costumes and scenery design , and a lot of energy from the talented cast . all told , this an enjoyable and lighthearted work , one of the director's minor works . 
a stylishly slick , romantic thriller , that is pleasing to the senses in a brainless manner . you have to remember that this film was made in the radicalized 1960s and that reason for robbing a bank might have been accepted back then in some circles of thinking . there's a closing scene with a twist of betrayal that was much influenced by the style of french new wave films . but the film will not be remembered for its plot or the twists in it , but only for the good chemistry in it between the cary grant-like suave demeanor of mcqueen and the the cool disposition of the good looking dunaway . though the sex scenes were not very fleshy , it was mostly foreplay via dialogue , the film , nevertheless , still sold itself on this game of sex between the two amoral fortune hunters . the film also offered an oscar winning song scored by michael legrand , windmills of your mind , and some fancy camera work of split-screen images by cinematographer haskell wexler . but if you are looking for anything but a fun film , i think you'll be disappointed . it turns out to be an easily forgettable caper movie that was pleasing on the eyes as much as easy on the noodle . 
dennis schwartz : " ozus' world movie reviews " 
the director is clearly more concerned with artful flourishes , elizabeth's lustfulness , and the modern ways to look upon a queen trying to be a ruler of men , rather than exploring further the tragic and specific drama of the times . this one's primarily a costume piece melodrama that enjoyably emphasizes the conspiracies surrounding the so-called virgin queen , who is destined to rule england's golden age for some 40 years . it was a scene that seemed out of place when compared to the rest of the film , even though it was a striking and memorable scene . elizabeth is a film with a propensity for depicting spacious castles that have dark interiors and characters who have dark intentions . elizabeth creates a panoramic view of 16th century england and its intrigues . it is a film that does a better job making elizabeth a vivid characterization , than it does of providing unforgettable dialogue and good storytelling . cate blanchett becomes elizabeth , giving her a modern feminist voice and a dark look inside her soul , in a daring performance that works out rather well , considering the film was emotionally flat and uninvolving . 
a real-life chilling tale of matricide is put forth in a complex build-up of an obsessive and passionate relationship between two very imaginative adolescent girls , set in christchurch , new zealand , between 1953 and 1954 . the 33-year-old director , new zealander peter jackson ( braindead/dead alive ) , previously known for making gore films , has come up with a stunning melodramatic story , spoiled only by the director's excessive camera shots of the girls' fantasy world , which was more arty than enlightening . pauline is shy but bright , heavy-set and plain looking , from a working-class and uneducated family , with a scarred leg from a few operations due to weak bone structure ; while , juliet is pretty and slender , worldly , aggressively sure of herself , from an upper-class , well-educated family , but is suffering from tuberculosis . by tossing fantasy and reality together in such a haphazard manner , it creates a world of disturbing visions , one in which the film holds the viewer's interest throughout . it feels like we can't quite grasp what is on the girls' minds , even if we are privileged to hear pauline's troubling voiceover , explaining her diary notations , even if we are caught by the exilaratingly romantic moods of the girls and their imaginative games they play . the acting by winslet and lynskey is superb . the film is also visually stunning , but the moral of the story is never made clear and there is bit too much pretentious fantasy art thrown into the script . 
he becomes the source of parody , as the doctors piece him back together , whereby he can't talk clearly , looks grotesque , and has holes in his throat so that when he smokes , the smoke can be seen coming out of his throat . the prison scenes were over-the-top , trashy , and fun to watch , as the director did not care a damn about drama or plot . the film shoots for tongue-in-cheek humor in the interactions between characters and also it aims to cast some black humor on the social hypocrisies of the welfare , judicial , and penal systems . as satire , this film is tops . it was excessive , but it had enough bite in it to do some damage . reese witherspoon's performance was contagious , watching her cut-up , act-tough , be vulnerable , and drop comic lines with a natural ease , and all the time , the film had the feel of being noir , even though it was really satire . it had enough toughness in it to be viewed as a thought provoking film , when the action cleared and the cartoonish-type of laughs emanating from the veggie-like characters died down . the film had a lot of little things going for it , that added up to big plusses . the film's opening credits had the grimm fairy tale story of little red riding hood depicted in its cartoon drawings . freeway has the look of a crazed fable , as bulky onscreen figures are made to look less imposing at each impending scene and the vulnerable ones either die or get stronger just by surviving amidst such violent chaos . the film draws to its inevitable conclusion- of blood and gore , despair and muted hope , and the irrelevancy of the 1990s in trendy california , which can be seen as a failed center-piece for social change . the film's sordid family scenario , leaves its sensationalized news stories mockingly imprinted on the airwaves , depicting how sad life is and how cartoon-like are the players , left to their own vanities , frolicking in an artificial landscape of alienation and violent gestures . 
following on the heels of " the exorcist " , " the omen " is another box-office success , one of many commercial horror thrillers spawned in the 1970s , and much better critically than most others . it is even a more satisfying film than the exorcist . what makes this film so captivating , is how it relies on narrative and not special effects to build on tension . this adorable cherub turns out to be none other than the antichrist . or maybe , by taking the bible literally , that can become a problem . how this film gets to hold its head higher than most of the other films of this nature , is because the acting is first-class , the telling of the story is tight , and the criss-crossing between london , rome , and jerusalem , is suspenseful . the film is in constant motion , so it is made difficult to stop and think , and reflect how much hokum there is in the story . so , i can't really blame the very prudish and politically sensible thorn for not believing the priest . this gets thorn's attention , at last . all this leaves the ambassador befuddled , looking only as gregory peck can look , when things that are supposed to make sense don't . while in jerusalem , there are a few more shocks , and the story excitedly swings back to london . here , a few more shocks develop . the film succeeds because it knows how to tell a suspenseful story and not rely on green vomit for its shocks , like the exorcist resorted to , as the omen manages to have its shocks look sensible and seem convincing . 
a verbose talk-fest , which is a play more than a visual film experience , as adapted by sidney lumet from ira levin's broadway play about a parlor murder game . lumet as always , sucks any subtlety out of his films . here he is in a bit of a frenzy in portraying the characters , relying more on plot twists than character development . in comparison with a similar-type of stage play put to the silver screen , joseph l . mankiewicz's sleuth , lumet's is clearly the inferior one . at this point , the film had a fluidity and a macabre comical tone to it . but , it changes in a drastically different direction , and the surprises in the plot , from here on , come about faster than a venice beach skateboarder trying to impress the bystanders . what eventually shines through , is how clever and manipulative the script is . i felt used by the characterizations , as it took away a lot of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of the storyline , that in the first act , worked really well . caine seemed marvelous at first , but i soon tired of his constantly frantic look . it was dyan cannon , with her sweet giggles and frustrated looks , who brought a needed restraint to the film , and as long as she was onscreen the film had an edge to it . too many contrivances made everything seem so superficial , which is a shame , because the film did have its funny moments . 
this is a coming-of-age film , that plays as bittersweet melodramatics . it's a pleasant little film , with its small aims hitting its target repeatedly , quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster must go through in order to grow up , and how the bland 1950s and its omens of the future in space travel , new pop-up toasters , and a tv in every house , influence the youngster's life . by being very easy to talk to , with no pretenses , he thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and makes his summer experience a joyous one . the film is charming , it is sad , it is true-to-life , and never maudlin or sugary . it's a good nostalgia film for all those yearning to look back at their childhood , even if it be only vicariously through ingemar . i fell for the film without being swept off my feet by it . the message underlying ingemar's experience , is that life holds so much suffering in it , that one might as well get a few laughs out of it while one can . the scenes of the snow on the tv screen while all the neighbors are brought in to watch a movie , the radio broadcast of the swedish boxer ingemar johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the american champ floyd patterson , and the challenging games kids play to compete against each other , all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the 1950s . 
it's an ambitious effort about how one can preserve one's dignity in the face of poverty . the picture tries to cover much territory , in this long epic-like , period-piece production of over two hours . it seems like a mess , as the film has too many stories going all at once and too many characters coming in and out of it to follow them all , and the acting is less than compelling . as a result , it is easy to lose track of the real-life figures for the cardboard symbols they represent , as the sides are drawn up -- the good guys are the struggling actors-and-the bad guys the industrial magnates . but , fortunately , the film rises to the occasion in its uplifting finale , bringing a renewed energy for its clear-cut message to be credibly received , at last . this is an old-fashioned liberal film , preaching its humanitarian message to the choir . the unfortunate thing about the film , is that it is not terribly entertaining . the film lumbered through by showing snippets of the theater rehearsals , introducing and then forgetting about a cast the size of an army . john adair ( sheridan ) is one of the actors who pushes her on-stage to get the part and he becomes her boyfriend , in a story that left me feeling unmoved , as it was just typical hollywood goo , seen many times before . the real-life characters from the theater group harldy fare better when portrayed : the bland marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) , who says he is not a communist but a homosexual ( but the point being made is that homosexuals are viewed just as badly as the commies are ) . they both gave forgettable performances . there are intertwined stories around the theater about the industrialists mixing with the fascists . these scenes could have been even more potently dramatic , if the miscast cusack was replaced by someone who could do a better rockefeller . at one point nelson says , " i must confess that i'm more interested in the oil in paint than the oil in derricks . " you've got to find a way to give them a dollar -- and take two ! " vanessa redgrave , in a stereotyped role , is gray's lightheaded , titled wife , countess la grange , with liberal aspirations and sympathy for the theater people . all these parts seem oversimplified , with the director pulling the strings as if the actors were puppets , and though the message is right-on , there was no immediacy or impact in the story . there was no art in the art , everything moved along predictably . i imagine that someone with much more political savvy and more experience directing than robbins , like mike leigh , could have found a way to get around this mess without altering where the sympathies should lie to pull off a more satisfying work . the cast and the audience then trekked uptown through the streets and saw the show there . there was no scenery , there was just blitzstein at the piano , and the play made history with a most thrilling and memorable opening . but , ultimately , politics aside , the trouble with the original play became what was the trouble with this movie version , the story and the music are just too dry , though the message it presents , is worth savoring . but , any film that can quote nelson rockefeller and also leave no mistake where those other industrial patrons of the arts stood , makes me recommend this well-intentioned but flat dramatic film solely on that basis . ah ! 
it's rare that a woman directs a noir film and especially one as hard-boiled as this one appears to be . the theme of the film could easily be : 'misery loves company . ' ms . greenwald's penchant for long close-ups of her disgruntled players , creates a noir feel for the film . she also adds strength to the noir style of the film , by having the dialogue stripped to the bare minimum . the film's downbeat mood reflects the characters and their dismal lives . she lacks the confidence to believe that she will be able to do a good job as a stripper . ms . greenwald , instead , lets the viewer see who killed luanne . the film failed to be a nail-biter and it wasn't psychologically deep , nor was it morally arresting , but what it had going for it in spades , was showing a feeling of malaise . a very competently made film , if you are willing to be taken down such dark stairs , where the light is very dim and the view is not that great and what becomes rewarding , is seeing how transfixed the characters are as they cannot change their ways , even if they come to realize that their life depends on positive changes occurring . 
cmdr . a well-crafted submarine psychological thriller , from a novel by richard sale . to barney's dismay , the torpedoes hit the freighter sinking it . no one will question barney doyle's patriotism . to the film's credits , ford's performance is well-mannered and credible . the action scenes of the eventual show-down between the rivals , makes for exciting cinema . it was hard to believe that everyone who wore a navy uniform could be that perfect . thereby a certain banality crept in to this otherwise compelling presentation . as for submarine type action films , this one as for human drama far outweighs the recently released u-571 , and also for authenticity , acting , and suspense . the only thing the newer version has over this submarine flick , is that it makes good use of how far the technology has come , as its digital special effects take full-advantage of that . 
here's one spectactle of a film ridley scott definetly made for the masses , a large-budgeted ( somewhere over 100 million bucks ) digital effects epic , a star wars film for grown-ups , with the intention to overwhelm you with its technical feats and please your senses with its photography and dazzle you with the roman colosseum gladiator events , and most of all , it tries to breathe new life into the much maligned and parodied heroic tale . art becomes subservient to the public's taste for what is deemed enjoyable . the film keeps reminding you in intervals of every 15-minutes , as if that was a spot to go for a commercial , that its aim is primarily to please the crowd . with a functional script to its credit , some fine bursts of mannered acting by russell crowe who is asked to carry the film and ably manages to ground it on his furtive looks of steel and his intense inner need for revenge , and the film's palatable heroic story of good versus evil , the film is a reminder of the old hollywood sword- and- sandal films of grandeur and muscle and frivilousness . though , it lacks the kind of political intrigue to be considered in the same class with kubrick's last fling with hollywood , spartacus . in modern times , it comes closest to aping braveheart . general maximus commands his troops to `unleash hell' on their underdog adversaries with an outpouring of arrows and flaming canisters to fill the screen with blood and gore and mud , and a beautifully framed picture of the barbarians' woods on fire and its landscape turned into an eerie hue of bluish-gray ash . scott succeeds in his visceral opening just like spielberg did in saving private ryan , of grabbing the audience's attention and keeping it for most of the film . he snarls and says things in a low but sure-fired baritone voice , that is heavily-laced with a macho australian accent " in this life or the next , i will have my vengeance . " the film is gaudy but it is entertaining , always a pleasure to look at even if it is disdainful to think what crass aims it is up to . oliver reed did a feisty job and stole a few scenes toward the end of the film with his cynical performance . russell crowe relished the fight scenes and gave the film exactly what it asked for . connie nielsen added some class to the storytelling . the film did match the uneven quality of the old hollywood film , the kind of standard epic that hasn't been made for a number of years , and probably won't be made after this one because of the prohibitive high budget . if you notice , sex is all but absent from the film , there is instead , plenty of violence . ah ! people's tastes are so fickle ! 
a crisp james cagney comedy vehicle , at a time when the 34-year-old actor was at the peak of his stardom . the film plays like a spoof on hollywood and on cagney's previous roles in gangster films as a tough-guy for warner bros . , and the result is a very funny film . the inside joke about the strand , is that's the cinema where warner bros . showed all their film openings in the 1930s , including where lady killer opened . the two seem to have a good chemistry working together . a breezy feature , showing cagney in his true light during the depression era of escapist films . it was in films like this one that gave his audience hope things no matter how ridiculous they seemed for them , could get better . this is strictly a star-vehicle film and one that is well-suited for cagney's talents . 
a noble idea for a film to satire some of the best known american pop culture heroes of the 1950s , as directed by the britisher nicolas roeg , from a terry johnson play conceived in 1982 . the film often misses the target , but since it throws everything into the mix , it sometimes is delightfully on target , providing both amusement and thought-provoking reactions . the fictionalized encounters , which try to capture the essence of the pop culture characters rather than depicting them as real-life characters , though using what knowledge the public has of them , the characterizations seem pretty close to the truth . what really makes this film work , are the excellent performances by the stars . marilyn is the life of the film , presenting a sexy and engaging sex goddess , who is both vulnerable and pushy . einstein is upset by that , mentioning that knowledge isn't something that is true-- it's just an agreement made by people that makes it seem true . the film is a bit of a mess , with no certain plot and it seems to have no particular aim it hopes to accomplish . but as a diverting look at these fantasies of the four 1950 icons , it makes for provocative theater and in the process , it sometimes offers us some inspired thoughts to think about . it sort of sucks you along for its ride and you don't mind going along because its kind of fun to imagine how those characters really were . the film's efforts might be comparable to a guy fantasizing how it would be to sleep with marilyn monroe . 
the league of gentlemen is a fine example of old-fashioned english humor : droll and civil . the film's strong suit is watching the precision planning that goes into the operation as it unfolds and how all these older blokes exhibit their odd personalties to mesh into a team-operation replete with proper military decorum . a very watchable caper movie , but with a decided british edge to it which might inhibit some american viewers from enjoying it as much . the lovable rogue characters give the film a spirited uplift , with hawkins , patrick , livesey , and attenborough being particularly good in their portrayals . what the film lacks is any kind of intensity , it's all comedy and manners . 
this most uncompromising film is based on the britisher j . g . but what this canadian film is trying to say about those subjects , is anyone's guess . my guess , after seeing this film three times , is that it is not trying to say anything that is revelational , but it takes a car crash -- something no one in their right mind can revel in and think they are sexually getting off on -- and depicts a sexual fetish cult that finds a car crash to be as stimulating as a sexual act . it is a film probing how strange the mind is , especially in this post-nuclear age ; and , how sex is created in the mind , and how sexual fetishes are no stranger than anything else conceived there . in lieu , of a regular storyline , the film consists of a series of obsessive scenes regarding car crashes and of having sex in a car . it is the kind of film that one will either love or hate . one thing can be said with a certain amount of reassurance , the film is a faithful adaptation of the book , even keeping the monotonous mood of the book's repetetive themes played out over and over again . at the 1996 cannes film festival , where it got mixed reviews of boos and cheers from the crowd , it nevertheless received a special jury prize for " originality . " the film has something to say that comes in the form of a veiled warning about the future of technology and the potential deepening psychopathology that is needed for a more benevolent humanity . it has caused ripples of controversy , not because of any theme it might have , but because of the sex scenes in the cars , its crossing of old moral boundaries in favor of pornography , and the way the film unfolds without a visible story . its naysayers said , it would encourage viewers to have sex while driving in their car , thereby causing accidents . all i could say to those arguments -- is horsefeathers ! if that's a legitimate reason to ban or knock a film , you might as well censor almost every film made as presenting some danger or another . one evening , james , helen , and catherine attend , what can only be described as a show that has an unusual theme , even for performance theater . hey , i've got no problems with them so far , but it seems more funny than it is serious . . . though there is something intangible about the emptiness of this film and its unwillingness to deliver any expected messages or cater to the masses demand to be entertained , that makes this film intriguing in a very special way . if the film disturbed or was meant to disturb , i can't really say that it disturbed me . it's a speculative work , like a test project , trying to see what it can come up with that works . that there is such a thing as someone having a car crash sex fetish like those in the film , seems unlikely . but that doesn't seem to matter . what matters is that this film is looking for something to say about the modern world and the new kind of strangeness it has developed . that everyone is dehumanized in this film , might be the point of it . the acting , for what the actors were asked to do-- that is , all act in an emotionless fashion except for the bizarre portrayal by koteas , is accomplished rather successfully . hunter is like them- dehumanized to a certain point , she seems to be interested in her own sexual self-satisfaction above anything else , and her near-death experience seems to have reinforced that need . for me , the story might be perceived as being more voyeuristic than controversial . it defies having a label attached to it . somehow , it drew me into its audacious storytelling . i am not annoyed to be put in the position of being a voyeur , as much as i am amazed by how all the cultists respond to their lives . the film itself is daring because it is different than other films , it covers ground where mainstream films dare not go ; its repetitiveness , its hermetic and absurd nature , make for a film that i like better than how it is perceived through all the hype it has received . i enjoyed it because it was so well-made and acted , and strangely enough , for a film that some criticized as pornographic , i found it to be in the best of taste . what it lacked was definition and perception , and a sense of getting out of its own awe-inspiring way . 
this fictionalized film looks as if it could be a documentary , shot in the cinema verite style . this kid's a downer , with a low attention span and a naive recognition of how messed up he is . just live in the snow . first-time director julian goldberger got into the kid's head and presented a haunting portrayal of what it is like to be lost and frightened in a world that is too complex for this junk food eating kid , who looks like a psycho with his crew-cut but is as soft as a twinkie . what the film does best besides have their unlikely antihero be the appealing voice of the film , is catch the desolate mood of the locale . what it forgets to do , is tell a good story . that the prison system is not the answer for kid's like this , is also obvious . why he was in prison is not given , but there's hints that he was picked up as a sniffer of chemicals or some other minor offense . this kid is certainly not a hardened criminal , which is the shame of it all , as there seems to be no answers from society or from this film what to do about lost souls like him . at least , the film makes clear that its position is that incarceration is not the answer , which certainly goes against the current grain of thinking in america . despite the film's good look and the way it uses a novel approach in its film language to echo what ryan is thinking , everything seems surface deep . it could have used something else to compensate for the mindlessness of ryan to go along with his painful tale of hopelessness and the film's evocative atmosphere , which wears thin after awhile . 
this film can be loosely pegged as a noir film , though it plays more like a typical 1950s caper movie . this minor slip-up , is why in a loose way , mike becomes a noir protagonist , though he doesn't have the dark side to his character this genre usually calls for . even the bank manager and the f . b . i . i think if the filmmaker reworked some of the loose ends left hanging in this film , there would have been a much stronger film to complement the very strong characterization of the earnest barry sullivan character the filmmaker was able to present . 
it stridently shows in its futuristic prediction what the united states might become like if the reactionary right-wing had their way . it is a polemic exercise between the left and the right , with no room for the middle point of view . though the director tries to present some of the establishments' arguments against these young dissenters to show that he is impartial , the weight of what is going down is so heavy , that even when the tribunal members make a plausible response , it still sounds vacuous given the current situation . they mostly say things like the protesters don't care about this country , that the vietnam war is a " just " war because it is aimed to stop the spread of communism , and that the protesters are trying to make a mockery of the american way of life . that the politician is nothing but a debater . while the pacifists' say that war is only just when it is entered into without any hatred in one's heart . the honorable thing to do at a crisis time like this , is be a criminal -- that at another time it might be to become a politician . the film had a gritty look to it and should bring back some of the worst confrontational memories of a time the country was divided in a very hostile way . what was missing from the film , was a sense that it could accomplish anything . but , maybe , that wasn't possible , especially looking at this film some thirty years later and realizing how there was no way to justify the war and the racism at the time . to add to that the fictional suspension of individual rights and a horror chamber like punishment park , makes this film seem like a futile diatribe that lost its prospective of what its aim was . yet , if the film's polemics disturbs , but fails to entertain as a film , it still had some bite in it , and its non-professional cast made this an unusual film , one worth watching for all the intensity it displayed despite its inability to alter any one's mind from their current views . it is , simply , preaching to the choir . 
this is an authentic " dogma 95 " film , as before the film opens , that assurance comes with a signed guaranteed shown on the screen that it was made according to the rules stipulated by the danish directors who founded this school of sparse filmmaking -- lars von trier and thomas vinterberg . the hand-held camera was obvious throughout the film as were the film's lack of special effects , supposedly giving the viewer a chance to discover on their own any beauty worth finding in the film , rather than to be hit over the head with it . like all dogmas , they eventually wear out whatever usefulness they might have had in the first place . soren kragh-jacobsen's " mifune " is dogma's third approved project , after vinterberg's " celebration " and von trier's " idiots . " it is the weakest of the three , but still , it has some punch in a conventional way due to the film's technical clarity . it is a playfully weird telling of a familiar romantic comedy situation , much like a hollywood formula film . it has a lot of dead spots where it tried comedy and a lot of predictability as far as its romantic situation , but it also had a certain intrinsic beauty about it that kept it afloat and made it seem better than its story was . it is , nevertheless , a surprisingly conventional work , which makes me wonder about all the fuss this dogma 95 group go through to give the impression that they are radical filmmakers . a rather trite choice of subject matter for a group that i would have thought to be more politically motivated . what worked well in this film , was that the actors had personality that flashed on the screen , and that there were some breathtaking nature shots of the golden sun going down and of the rich colors of the danish backwater fields . this film doesn't go against that observation . now i would have bet anyone in the theater and have given them 10-1 odds , that was the last of the marriage , that's how obvious this plot was . her smile is the pure one , while claire also smiles , but her's is a selfish one . this dogma 95 film left me unmoved , though its story was pleasant and well-crafted . it just felt too much like an art-house film designed to please its audience rather than to be provocative . 
inspired by the 1994 novel by william trevor , this is a film about a serial killer that promised to be more inspiring than it turned out , even though it is an excellently crafted film and has more to offer than the usual serial killer film does . it , somehow , takes a familiar journey down this director's path even if it seems the director is drifting off into foreign territory . the innovative canadian of armenian descent , atom egoyan , who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does here , revisits the themes of betrayal , familial ills , religious conflicts , sexual secrets , videotapes , and uncertain identities . bob hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered , even if he chews the scenery to gain such control , but , nevertheless , he is engaging as a manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and frightening . what fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production , is that everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end . we are led to believe we understand too much about this serial killer and that he can be redeemed , but the reality is , that we understand too little about him , despite the appropriate effort that is made to understand him . when the nature of the relationship hoskins has in mind with felicia becomes obvious , the film can't recover from this knowledge and it becomes more natural for the audience to care that the angelic cassidy somehow survives what is intended her , rather than the film going into deeper and more unfamiliar ground . this serial killer film falls below the achievements of m and peeping tom , as it falls into the range of films that miss their mark but are still enriching . 
this is a winning madcap comedy , enhanced by the mercurial pairing of jackie chan with owen wilson , featuring a fluid script and some irrespressible comedy routines . though the plot of the film revisits familiar territory , of the rescue of the princess tale , and the idea of a buddy movie , where characters who are opposites must mesh together . but , what overcomes that familiarity , is the energy and chemistry the two co-stars have and their ability to look good on-the-screen together . what results are well-executed pratfalls , lots of sight gags , ingenuous fight scenes , some stupid ethnic jokes and the flaunting of indian stereotypes , but whereas those old westerns had the bias be for real , here's its in jest and , all the while , the film keeps the comedy rolling on . though not all the comedy works , the scenes of owen in the whorehouse were stale and offered the lowest kind of vulgarian humor . but there is something inexplicable about the stars that make this film effective and able to overcome its triteness . it was better than what i expected from a jackie chan hollywood film , and credit must be given to first-time director tom dey for making the film so appealing and so people friendly . it should prove well in the box office , probably reaching past its targeted teenage audience , and after all , this is a business film . . . whose 
a sometimes funny parody and uncanny black comedy , about incest , sexual repression , and the jewish mob . but its failure to be consistently on focus with its characters' comings and goings , in what seems like a pointless amount of gore being displayed , acts to undermine the film's artful plot set-up . as the film is too often off target , bringing up too many subjects for it to handle , it just fires away , taking aim at everything in its way and missing just as often as it hits . the breaking of the nose gives rise to the saying , i could have beaten him six ways to sunday . there is no smooth sailing in this difficult story to behold , which might have something to do with love . if love is the message here , it is not the conventional kind , but it is one that is stranger and stronger than harry's repressions , hatred and violence . everytime one looks up on the screen , someone seems to be getting violently bumped off , yet harry manages to survive and will leave youngstown with iris by the film's end , which , oddly enough , after all the mayhem and absurdity of harry's insane life , the film turns out to have a temporarily happy ending . this might be the strangest thing about this film , for a film that has gone out of its way to be stranger than fiction or love . this film should appeal mostly to those who like offbeat stories and their comedy to be darker than black , and don't mind if confusion is the main ingredient that propels the story . i took it at face value to be black comedy and found myself laughing often , though the people i saw it with , thought it was over-the-top in blood and gore , and found little in it to like and found the film was far too self-indulgent to work as a love story for them . 
small time crooks is a small time comedy , nourished by getting a fast start off the gate with some pretty familiar comedy routines -- it starts off paying homage to the italian film " big deal on madonna street , " but it is not able to sustain that homage or carry on with the fast-paced comedy hi-jinks after the first half hour , and what's worst , it falls into a predictable way of telling the story , which ends the film on a rather pedestrian note . this film had the look of something made in a film factory , without an edge to the routine comedy sequences . but to its credit . . . it had a lot of laughs in it . he seems to have given up being an artistic filmmaker ( i doubt if he ever was committed to being one , but he did like ingmar bergman's " wild strawberries , " and at one time attempted to make bergman-quality films ) . he's certainly no risk taker in this film , knowing his audience and giving them what they want might as well be his motto . he is banking on the audience cravings for a few of his patented one-liners to give them a comedy fix until his next predictable work . here's where this sweet and silly story plunges off the comedy map , as it tries to show how tracy now wants to grow as a person and join the highbrows and get some culture , but she can't because she still remains a vulgar person inside despite her new outward trappings . the running gag here is how cheap their taste is in their furnishings , decorations , clothes , and vocabulary , before and after becoming rich . this results in a fluff film , with a twisted message about money not being important to the couple , which seems like an out of the place message , since money is all the couple talks about and seem to care about as a means for their happiness . but this is a film that will only succeed if it can make you laugh and the message wrongly or rightly perceived might as well have not been sent . there are just enough woody sight gags and one-liners to make this film keep its head above water . . . for example , one gag goes like this : " hey , did you hear the one about that polish car pool that met at their workplace ! ! ! " 
this is the original film adaptation of the graham greene semi-autobiography . the older b&w version puts less stress on the lust and more on the inner conflict the two lovers are having . it's a more reserved telling of the story , probably due to the conservative time it was filmed than anything else . this version actually leaves a greater impact on the viewer of the momentous tragedy of the self-imposed restrictions religion has placed on the relationship for her . the story never seems illogical , as does the tacky ending to the later version , which tried to get too fancy in its approach to this melodramatic love story . there was no reason to make a remake , and especially so , since the newer version doesn't add anything new to the mix that the older version didn't already have . what evolves through greene's telling of the inner spiritual battle worked out through the characters , is that what is impossible becomes what is religious and man's worldliness is seen as something that is not completely satisfying to him but is something he thinks he needs to satisfy because he doesn't believe in an afterlife . that she loves him so much , that to just have him live will be worth it . the priest responds , " you made a vow to someone you didn't believe in -- you have the free will to break it . " but you have also taken the first step toward god , that you could continue with , if you so choose . dmytryk has made an intelligent and cogent version of a tough novel to film , and made it into an impressionable film . the best performances in the film came from the two actors who seemed to be effortlessly acting , john mills , as the detective interested more in the craft of his job than the ethics , though always aware of the moral implications of what he is doing . his pleasurable performance stole the film . in many respects , i found this the more interesting version . what the other version had , was more explicit sex scenes and a better actor playing bendrix . 
mankiewicz does a nice job of creating the dark noir mood . the film is laden with comedy , excellent performances , plenty of suspense , plus a voice-over by john ireland , and it manages to keep the pot boiling with a quintessential amnesiac story . 
this is another in a long line of indie 'buddy films' about desperadoes going on the road . the only thing different about this one , is that it is consciously played for laughs , which gets it through its cartoonish lowbrow humor , as it features characters who all have something about them that is dysfunctional : they are illiterate , have a depraved mental condition , suffer from greed , or just like to kill people . it's a teenager's version of the noir classic " the treasure of sierra madre , " lacking the breath and depth in its story to touch base with the classic , but letting its own dimwitted energy do its talking , for what it stands for . the road it takes is across the southwestern desert and across the barren culture of the white trash trailer park crowd . she's a mute and communicates by writing . there is nothing that we haven't seen before in such road films , from a vintage car convertible to a gun fetish to white trash humor , and finally to random violence , but there is a surprise ending here involving , what else , but , betrayal for the gold . even though there were many look-alike films , this black comedy could at least stand alone for the laughs it presented . the characters all had personality , and the force of the movie overall , had a desirable effect , even if it is an easy film to forget and requires as little thinking as possible when viewing . enjoyable nonsense might be an apt description for former adman rod mccall's second feature . 
the story is bogged down with cliches and cardboard characters , while the ballet dancing is the thing of beauty in this film . most of the dancers are professionals of the highest standards and it shows by their excellent performance . the framework of the story is the same formula seen in almost every hollywood sports film , as the art of dancing is only paid lip service to . in fact , if this film wasn't about ballet dancers , it could have been about chorus dancers or football players , and the same trite tale could have been woven . which shows you how much art mattered . the best reason for seeing the film , is that the dancing is alive and pulsating , choreographed by the likes of balanchine , susan stroman and christopher wheeldon , as well as ivanov and macmillan . the film is hip to ballet dancers , letting us in on the secret that many of the male dancers are gay , and a straight dancers is much welcomed by the ladies . and , that they can be easily devasted by criticism of their performance . it is was too much effort following all their predictable stories , especially when you know everything is going to be tied up in a nice pink ribbon by the end . this film reminded me a lot of hollywood's ode to lowbrow culture " band wagon , " which was much more entertaining . in center stage , there was plenty of dancing at rehearsals and in the two big ballet numbers they put on , before the film comes to its predictable climax for its soap opera stories . the aim of the film was to be entertaining , the art part it dumbed down for mass consumption , though its story could have been worst than it actually was , as it was kept in check from completely taking over the film . what it comes down to , is that the story didn't completely take away from the dance , therefore the film had some mild entertainment value and some sparkle could be detected in the eyes of the students when they were dancing . 
it's an absorbing story but it was presented in such a mangled way , so a lot of the drama was sucked out of it and it instead became an obvious sob story about an injustice done . this steven zaillian directed film has traces of the same intelligence he has shown in his previous work as director of searching for bobby fischer and as a screenwriter for schindler's list , but loses its fire-power with scenes of endless court hagglings and what seems like an interminable amount of time spent in giving prep classes on how the court system works . this sets-up a battle of david versus goliath . the supporting players all have limited roles compared to the two gunslingers , travolta and duvall , but perform admirably . for all its telling faults in its storytelling ability , the film had an aura of reality about it that the john grisham movies never have . while duvall is shown as the masterful machiavellian tactician with absolutely no heart , whose m . o . what the film failed to do , is to bring a sense of urgency to their presentation . though they were sympathetic to the families' plight and caught the essence of what travolta was up against , which makes it better than most hollywood films , it just couldn't drive the fastball thrown down the middle of the plate over the 'green monster' in fenway park for a home run . the story became less than compelling and more of an exercise about who was the better actor/lawyer duvall or travolta . the great social impact of the lawsuit never caught on during the film , when that should have been the driving force of the film , as it was when grippingly told in the book . 
the simple story taps in on the hatred the railroad people have for the tramps . aldrich for the most part steers clear of the political situation in the country , instead he uses these men as powerful mythic symbols , showing the oppressed versus the oppressor . while borgnine is a sadist , who sports a menacing grin . if the kid could just shut up and be grateful that he is learning how to be a hobo from the king , marvin could have warmed up to him a little . marvin is terrific as the spry and wizened hobo . borgine is a caricature of someone spewing hatred . it's just too bad that the director couldn't connect all the dots with the corrupt political situation that caused this great suffering and left so many with hardened hearts . 
he met the director chris smith when he took a course of his in filmmaking at the university of wisconsin , and smith found that mark's story might be a compelling one , showing how by sheer determination someone can make a film and get it distributed . at the sundance film festival , an appreciative audience found this film hilarious and the festival responded by awarding it the grand jury prize . the film is more interesting when viewed from the angle of mark's personal life and where he's currently at than from him making an ed wood jr . classic film . that he is not always a likable person is also shown , as he uses people and is a bull-shit artist . it all amounts to a home movie more on the level of a precocious teenager than the work of a professional . mark pronounces it with a long 'o' because he doesn't want it to rhyme with oven . but his good will shines through , as every sentence he tries to utter results in a pause and a frivolous giggle . uncle bill is a riot in his lifeless responses to anything mark asks him , wryly amused at how serious mark is over a film he could care less about . mark is indomitable in his pursuit of his dream and chris smith has done a fine job of editing the film and nailing down his subject as accurately as he could , so that the dark side is balanced with the rosy picture mark paints for himself . all this film did was make him a laughing stock instead of the audience discovering someone with a talent for comedy . i have no desire to see coven , watching it being made was enough for me . mark's first words in the film are , " i was a failure . " he goes on to say , " he was a talented kid with a bright future , " and he wound up at 30 , as mark , with a beer in his hand , thinking about the great american script and the great american movie . " what more can one say ! 
how she handles the few dramatic moments of her life , right before her high school graduation , is what makes this a very french film . but , i guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder , because he didn't look like a train wreck to me . the beauty in the film is in judith godr ? che portrayal , that gets the most out of the terse dialogue and slim story , as she manages to look alluring in many different poses and who through her vitality and cynicism , always gives off a sense of hope that she will survive , no matter the situation . she fits the lifestyle of the existential hero . . . a female version of a camus hero or a rimbaud protagonist . the film had a very lively pulse which added to its intelligent drama . 
larry cohen's auspicious debut film is a scathing black comedy set in beverly hills . there seemed to be a break down in society and cohen isn't interested in why but in what is happening to the country . but he lets the suspense go to pieces and eases the heavy rape scene with social comedy and gentrified manners . it is sordidly funny in spots and at other times it just seems shrill and pretentious . there were too many flat spots between the mesmerizing opening scene around the swimming pool and the bleak finale in a sand dune , to make this quirky effort work entirely . it seemed to be toying with the audience for its acceptance or disapproval , more than anything else . bone is a film desperately trying to get under one's skin , but doesn't have enough staying power to complete the job , except it leaves one with a lingering feeling of being unduly provoked and still laughing about it . it fits nicely into cohen's concept of film as schlock art . cohen will split the screentime with bill and bernadette at this point . bone had its moments in the sun , but couldn't get out of its shadow in time to say more than boo ! what remains chewy about it , is the bizarre psychology evoked . it is a film that will be pleasing to some much more than it will be to others ; it could be admired for its originality and for its quirkiness , but there are others who might see it strictly as an exploitive film . the film had moments when it was both terribly good and terribly raunchy . 
the film was done much like a jean genet psychological drama . a-lan's soft spoken words are , " i'm gay . it is easy to get together here . i have many friends : the stud , dandy , and lily . the film is noteworthy for the skilled performances by the two actors and the political message of the film , as delivered in such an oppressive climate as red china . it is a film that reveals how intolerant the government is of both gays and of independent filmmakers . zhang yuan confines the film to the two actors stuck in the police station and it is only via flashback that we get to see a-lan's life unfold . this kind of action is symbolic of china's s & m relationship with its own people . even though it is a stagy film , the drama remains intense , as the explosiveness between the two keeps one glued to the final outcome , wondering how this odd relationship will work itself out . the gray-green and amber background of the park and the shadowy black shades of the public toilets , give the film a somber look . if nothing else , this is a rare glimpse at modern red china's gay denizens , as recorded by a maverick filmmaker . 
saskia emotes in a contrasting understated performance to the energetic amanda's . at one point the sweet talking miriam declares , " mother , auntie kathy , a girl at swimming--and eunice , those are all the people who have kissed me . " this is a pointless , violent road movie about two very sick girls , who are not explained or studied , but are just shown to be on a wreckless course of destruction . but judy might also be viewed as a figment of her warped mind , or perhaps she represents someone from the bible , like the avenger named judith who beheaded an enemy of the israelites . amanda displays a death wish , saying , " i'm bad , i won't change . punishment is all i understand . " it is not possible to make sense of how these girls relate to each other and how brutally they act . the depravity and depth of alienation she evokes from her character , and the energy that amanda plummer puts into her characterization , make this a fascinating film , if you can ever get past the bleakness of the story . 
a splendid tv movie remake of fritz lang's 1941 man hunt . o'toole's performance is the thing here . why he does it is only given a fuzzy interpretation . clive donner makes o'toole grow into a character that is larger than his country , playing off his petulance , his wit and charm , against his daring skills to look death in the eye and heroically escape his pursuers . what the filmmaker does , is have o'toole make great scenes out of conventional ones . even though o'toole is the one trapped in the hole , the major seems to be the one suffocating on the truth , even as he puts on an air of decorum and lays it into his captive , his talk just sounds like jabbering when compared to o'toole's . in this film , not being able to talk properly , means that you are more of an animal than an animal is . 
it's all about money and pride . the film is long on man-against-nature action scenes filmed with graphic computerized special effects , but short on character development and human drama . it is a commercial film , driven by the usual formula used for disaster movies . it is directed by wolfgang petersen , the german director of " das boot , " the best submarine picture ever made . the film succeeds as a nail-biter . when their vessel is down , bobby tells the captain , we gave it good ride . . . words that seem futile and misplaced , though certainly gallant . but it is the only glimmer of intelligent dialogue that appeared to be taking place in the last 45-minutes , ever since the giant waves crested against the boat and the men could only be seen in the dark with their yellow slickers . even though the film has a bleak ending and awkward dialogue , it has blockbuster written all over its sails . i think the public will accept the grim outcome and relish viewing the storm and the terrible damage it causes , because it is the kind of action film they will want to see this summer , while they munch on some popcorn in an air-conditioned theater . 
this scorsese " mean streets " type of film has been done too many times and often much better than it was done here , for it to have much of an impact . it was mildly entertaining , setting a wiseguy mood in a wealthy suburban area instead of using the usual locale of the gritty urban streets . but the film had such a pat look to it , i just couldn't help feel that it was phony , an annual staging of a movie about wannabe mafia youths that seems to be the dream-baby of almost every new indie director . it seemed to be striving to get some laughs , release some suburban angst , while trying to find the missing ingredient in its tale of innocence lost . . . which it never found . the 26-year-old first-time director rob weiss , has this low-budget film put all its cards on the action table , moving it along at a fast clip . the weakness of this plot , is that the friendship among the three never seemed to be anything but a superficial one , yet we are supposed to believe it is packed with a great deal of emotion at present . billy is just a bad egg , a weasel . it is difficult to find one thing about him that is likable . i also found it hard to believe that he became a big-time criminal , he just seemed to be too punky . the problem with this creepy friendship tale , one solely based on criminal schemes and drug deals , is ultimately the problem with this film -- because when the friendship breaks up , who cares ! and if we don't care , the film becomes empty , though it's good for a few laughs . 
the story becomes too melodramatic for even these fine performers to bring credibility to it . the camerawork of john alton is the star of this vehicle . he sets a dark mood of the los angeles scenario , escalating the dramatics with shadowy building shots . the noir theme of alienation is richly furnished , but the film had too many scenes that stretched too far afield in disbelief for it to have the necessary flow in it to sustain the tension . stanwyck was just too strong a character to be so completely victimized , so the film became more symbolic than a real flesh and blood story . 
apparently , the judicial system has broken down , so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders . the prison atmosphere of hostility , constant danger , noise , and inhumanity , was fully captured , as the film had the gritty , realistic look of a prison . the convicts looked scary , the prison looked real , and the feeling of despair was the only air that was present , as rehabilitation seemed to be a farce , a show that one puts on to score clemency points from the judges . the acting was just fine . i don't know if anyone seriously believes anymore that the prisons can be a place of rehabilitation . the film does a very good job in bringing this out and creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances . but it also seemed to stage everything in the story to weigh heavily into what its message was . the film didn't feel like it was freely flowing along , and because of that the story floundered at times . 
a taut suspense yarn in b&w , that plays like noir because of all the eerie shadows on the wall and the conviction for murder of an innocent man . this villain role is out of character for the always sweet ann sothern , but she shows great agility in handling the difficult role . the melodramatic script was often not believable and the action part of the story looked like pretend acting , just like the therapy nancy davis was applying to gigi . but the stars pulled this one together and made the tense story , revolving around the little girl , seem plausible . gigi perreau was marvelous , giving a convincing performance as a little girl who could be both adorable and then almost frightened out of her mind . 
" layin' low " is a charming comedy set in the brooklyn of the 1980s and laden with plenty of colorful city types . the film ends in tragedy , but somehow the film never draws us into that emotional-caring response . the ensemble cast does a nice job in sketching city life for a bunch of idlers . it's a sweet , little mellow story , with a lot of laughs in it , and with some violent scenes which never seemed real , more like play-acting . there was good chemistry among the stars , especially the relationship jerry has with both christy and angie . 
a good old-fashioned mystery yarn , from john dickson carr , but this time instead of the lady vanishes , it is the husband who does . oddly enough , the one person who clearly saw her , the stewardess , denies seeing her . the story itself , if examined closely had many improbabilities , but the strength of the film is in the tension it creates within crain and how she handles it . she had a blind trust in him and it is hard for me to imagine another person in her situation acting as naively as she does . but even if i didn't find the plot to be always plausible , the relationship that developed between her and rennie was credible . this b&w melodrama was always suspenseful : there was the constant heavy fog that made things mysterious . crain seemed so helplessly alone , highlighted by showing her sitting by herself at the dining table and feeling that she is losing her mind , that set the mood for the entire film and her vulnarability is what the viewer identifies with . this excellently paced b-film , is tersely directed and superbly acted . the film seemed to be thrust forward by the credibility of the characters playing parts that were incredible . 
this film has a gentle way of showing the war between the bureaucrats of big business and the little man caught in the squeeze of downsizing for greater company profits . how effective the film was , depended on how much you thought hopkin's change mattered . i only felt i was seeing a frank capra type of social-issue picture , that only goes surface deep , accenting how wonderful and eccentric the little guy is and how cold-hearted are the corporation types , resulting in too many generalizations of each type . but the place has not kept up with the modern times and is in need of a shot in the arm . the film will keep track of how the likable but goofy carey does in the romance department . this happy ending seemed artificial . . . too 
this premise would seem improbable , but in the recent news of the geriatric john glenn going on a space mission for experimental purposes , it shows that their mission is possible , though not in the manner as depicted in this fantasy film . there are a lot of good natured jokes about aging and some friendly ribbing between the young astronauts and the veterans , and it all seems pleasantly entertaining , though somewhat staged . clint even makes fun of some of his older pictures , which i presume is why he has so much fun with the monkey in the opening scene . everything seemed smooth and compliable with a formula movie , and it seemed as if the actors were having a good time acting together . but through the wonderful special effects and the full cooperation of nasa as consultants , there was a sense of awe in seeing the sights of space travel . and , when clint is able to make an impossible landing , something hollywood films are good at doing , there is a sense of relief that the old timer , who now has a lined and craggy face and looks like an american icon , is safe and sound . since the film didn't take itself so seriously , there was no undue tension and everything was fun , even all the contrivances the film allowed for . this is not one of clint's top films , but if it is his swan song , as rumored , there are a lot of reasons why this is not a bad film to end one's career on . the love and affection from his fellow actors comes through loud and clear , in this well-crafted production , which shows clint could direct with the skills that only the most competent hollywood directors possessed , even if clint never reached greatness himself , as he was unable to overcome his artistic limitations . what he couldn't do in this film , was move beyond the easy humor and special effects , and make a film that had something involving to say about old age and those facing death . 
the film is stunningly beautiful , as visually , it is a masterpiece . the film's thessaloniki landscapes are monumental , but at times , the story was pretentious and much too tedious . the other evident influences on the greek filmmaker are bergman's somber look at family life and antonioni's picturesque and quirky photography . but the little dialogue there was seems too supercilious anyway to really matter , as the weight of this film is captured only in its photography . but the story seems too symbolic and arty to make a direct impact , every thought , no matter how banal , has to be philosophically scrutinized , which becomes unnerving . to its credit , the film has certain scenes that stay with you the way a meditation exercise does , that may even alleviate some of the dullness the film generated , but it falls far short of a film that is great . the 66-year-old director has made an accessible film despite its ambiguity , but it was lacking fluidity in its overstated symbolism and its idiosyncratic statement was not that deep for all its huffing and puffing , and pouring out of philosophical thoughts . the film could have ended forty minutes sooner and still would have said what it ended up saying . 
a further vulgarization of shakespeare's most vulgar play that succeeds in going over the top and losing its sensibilities without adding anything worthwhile to take the place of what was lost , yet it is not without its positives . this early tragedy written by the young bard is also his weakest and most turbulent play , casting out dramatical dimensions , poetry , and pity in favor of gore . it is a difficult one to come to terms with , except to see it for its dark humor and parody . anthony hopkins plays titus with the same kitsch he played hannibal lecter , but without the same results . the film was also overlong at 162 minutes , without having a sufficient reason for being that long . cumming's plays his role as an insecure , campy effete , prancing about as a puff , coifed in an adolph hitler hairstyle , as he aims to steal every scene by his gyrations and petulant looks . it all seems glossy and avant-garde , but surprisingly , the film is most faithful to shakespeare's text . titus will then slit her throat with the appetite of a psychopath , smacking his lips with delight as his chef's hat bobs up and down . the emperor's fate is also sealed in a similar manner . not every work by shakespeare has to be great , even though , if the bard wrote it , there has to be something there . this one suffers from worldliness , hollowness , and from having no point to it ; i doubt if any screenplay could rescue it from its banality of violence . julie taymor's version was a good costumed effort to show the violence for all that it is , but in the process making it into a campy grand guignol production . but i found it all coming together too artificially . it was an art-house film , way too fluffy to serve the film's dramatic efforts , as it all seemed like a fellini rip-off , taking the subtlety out of shakespeare's work for all the excesses engendered . 
what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another . grant feels like he is just marking time by teaching , that all the kids will just become ditch-diggers anyway , so it is a waste of time teaching them to read . this film adapted from the novel by ernest j . gaines has the mark of truth and morality on its side . it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country . what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money . 
he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , the film still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain point as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault . 
this watchable neo-noir tale is all style and not much on substance . the intense acting and the quirky dialogue , plus the numerous plot twists and the penetrating character study enable the film to be entertaining in a nuanced way . it is also interesting to note that the film pays homage to great mystery writers such as graham greene , ernest hemingway , and malcolm lowry . the film works best as a hard-boiled character study , where eric roberts makes it believable that someone could end up in such an untenable position as he does , yet survive because he has the instincts for survival no matter how bad it gets . it is believable that he ran away from regular life--that he just wanted to test himself , which is the gloomy beauty of the story , giving it its kafkaesque feel . it's a story that doesn't seem to be leading anywhere or have any message to deliver , and thank goodness for that . it's probably a male oriented film more than a film for a general audience , a cult film for those who like offbeat noir films and mystery writers who get drunk and write scripts that have their flawed protagonist put their ladies on pedestals , only to delight in watching them fall off those pedestals . 
these misguided adventures are things a kid needing but not getting parental help might do . he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . the film with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain extent as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a father undergoing a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault . 
what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another . grant feels like he is just marking time by teaching in such a barren place , that all the kids will just become ditch-diggers anyway , so it is a waste of time teaching them to read . this film adapted from the novel by ernest j . gaines has the mark of truth and morality on its side . it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country . what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money . 
the director is ultimately asking the viewer to be the judge , as he seems too preoccupied with painting his canvas with a love that gets stuck somewhere between a lustful sexual romp and one of pathos . what results in an incomplete ending for a film that can't stand clarity except in its photography and its affection for the three flawed main characters ( alice , martin , and benjamin ) . the story seemed jarring at times , its inexorable rhythms and its lack of dialogue seemed out of place with the attempt made in tracking each character down in depth . yet the film seems to work best when it was in a state of murkiness . when things started clearing up and the characters become who we think they were , the big secret doesn't seem that surprising , but how it is handled seems bizarre though not fully credible , as it is perplexing why the main character is so concerned with finding out something about himself that will cause him so much pain when he doesn't have to . yet there is something about this film that is more than meets the eye , even though the film left me unsatisfied , it was still so well-crafted , that i found myself liking it better than i first thought i did . the film does not necessarily go in chronological order , thereby the flashbacks that come without order , are meant to give weight to the story as presented at the time , and will give this rather conventional unhappy family story line a feeling of much more mystery than is needed . but it's too melodramatic , the guilt motivation seems too illogical , and the half-baked psychology fails to explain its characters for it too fully work as drama . the actors were all sweating their lines to make it seem as if they had to dig deep to come up with a gem here and there , but their performances were all finely tuned and seemed to add to the film's need to have confusion be its guiding light . what keeps this film going , is the way it keeps the emotional pot boiling , and just when you are ready to give up on it as merely sitcom stuff , the film bounces back from its wordless silence and halting love dramatics to boil over with fits of liberating agony . there was no dialogue to explain why he's a fugitive or what's on his mind . she turns down this proposal , but with a look more of sadness than of love , she goes to him and says , " take me , i'm yours if you want me . " you have to stick with this one and not get too perturbed by the unsatisfying finale to see this one through and then , you might feel its emotional grip growing on you . it's a pure cinematic vehicle , where the pictures tell the story better than the story seems to be told . there was a strangely felt wry humor that underscored the dead serious mood the film had . alexis loret , in his debut film role , gives an interesting performance of someone who is always out of place no matter where he is . but , when it comes to the heavy romance , i didn't feel that this romance was as deep as portrayed . though the director might have implied it had more going for it than sexual gratification , i saw no other convincing reason for the romance . it could be asserted that maternal instincts , soul searching , and misplaced pathos on juliette's part were responsible for the romance , but i couldn't see any other reason but the libido . martin was just not a warm enough character to believe he could generate so much unconditional love . 
a very entertaining kitsch film , with great costumes , a fine sense of adventure , and an ample sprinkling of comedy . this technicolor mgm film is a remake from the 1920 and 1930 films , that were based on a play by edward knoblock . the sets are lavish and fun to look at ; the bouncy acting fits the playfulness of the fantasy story . the mix-ups are devilishly funny , and how the film gets resolved is fun to watch , as there are magic tricks that are performed and songs that are so bad that they are good , and a host of cast members come in and out of the film so seamlessly , adding their stamp of delightful bemusement to a very diverting film , which seems to be effortlessly done . this makes for some lightweight entertainment and some not so bad viewing from purely an entertainment standpoint . 
a modern noir story whose task seems to be to romanticize violence , with the film looking too much , at times , like a tarantino-clone . but there are scenes that are fresh and invigorating , filled with a deadly explosiveness , but somehow the film fails to put it all together to get at what it is trying to unearth from all the gunplay . it looked at that point , that the film would be very energetic , since that scene was so powerful and so crass -- and original . but the filmmaker fell in love with the violence and couldn't control his bad impulses to do the entire film as an exercise in mindless violence . armed with a highly polished script , lots of arty gunfights , and a convoluted , labyrinth story line , more interested in double-crosses and twists in the plot than human feelings , the film turned off on too many dead-ends to fulfill its potential . if you like gunplay done as choreography , as in recent hong kong action films or in sam peckinpah's " the wild bunch , " and films that prefer violence to sex , action to thinking , and films that discard humor for references that film buffs can go bananas over , a film that models itself after classic movies of criminals on-the-run , then you could be on board for this one , at least , more than other viewers who might find this film is not as good as the films it is imitating . parker and longbaugh are the real-life surnames of butch cassidy and the sundance kid . a shapeless story and an unmoving character portrayal of its anti-heroes get in the way of " the way of the gun " for director-writer christopher mcquarrie , who won an academy award for his unusual script in the overrated " the usual suspects . " he has come up with a reasonably intricate script here for his debut film as a director , but it lacks a certain flow and credibility for it to be a bravura debut . there was a stop-and-go flurry in the action causing the story to grow dull , with guns always the answer to whatever the problem , and its situations took on a suspension of disbelief , leaving a huge void onscreen amid the dark ambivalence of the story line . but what was always absorbing was the actors spouting lines that seemed to come out of their mouths in an unnatural manner , yet had a touch of playfulness , as they mugged for the camera . unfortunately , the film doesn't have any touching moments to fall back on and there is no one worth caring about , so in the midst of all the violence , it is fair to ask what is it all about , besides being a parody on such films . the violence and gore that ensues , plus the twists to the story , offer no big surprises . in fact , it almost seems like hundreds of other " b " films , contrary to what the director might think . his role took him in and out of the film , as it didn't seem to matter what he was spouting , he could have been doing the script to another film it wouldn't have mattered , he still was the film's source of charisma even if he was cast in a supporting role . i was amused with his definition of karma , saying karma is just a belief in justice where you don't even get the pleasure of seeing justice in your lifetime . it's an inaccurate definition of karma , but it was one spot in the film that made you think . but basically this is the type of film that gives ammunition to those who are bashing hollywood for its exploitive tendencies to sell violence . in the last third of the film juliette lewis is a bloody mess , having a baby all the characters pretend to have an interest in , even the fatalistic parker becomes concerned about the baby , but while she is having an excruciatingly painful delivery , one of the film's many shoot-outs is taking place . it seemed the film was more interested in the shoot-outs than in getting to anything else to say . the film was pleasing in the most superficial of ways without offering anything to say about the inner workings of the two thugs who are the centerpiece of the film . the camerawork was superb , and even though the gunplay was phony it filled the screen with stylized action scenes that were mindlessly diverting . the film could be viewed as a guilty pleasure for those who realize that the script let them down but the actors came through with flying colors . they got the graphic violence down pat for a few sparkling thrills , and the film showed that violence is so pervasive in society that even a woman gets punched in the nose by the gunmen , which i guess , goes for equality in this film ! a film that has future cult popularity written all over its ambivalent signature , as the violence had an unsettling nature to it that will probably grow on art-house viewers of thrillers who will catch it on video . there is something intangible about this film that is a reflection of present day society and its ever-increasing nihilistic ways . what the film doesn't do , is go beyond exploiting this nihilism . 
the set is bristling with problems and tension . while the topical story is about the business and cynicism involved in making a picture , and the vanity of those in the field , its deeper concern is with understanding the personal nature of failure , insecurity , and disappointment . the film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of the intelligent discretion of minnelli in his directing and the fine acting from the two male leads , with robinson's performance being nothing short of brilliant , enough to lift this film on his shoulders alone to a loftier dimension . 
their relationship becomes the heart of the film , rather than the mystery story . the film's main asset is that it is played as a psychological character study of the jane fonda character , who becomes a prostitute because she can control men and is good at it . their love affair which emerges unexpectantly , is unsettling to both of them , but real feelings develop on both sides , to the surprise of each , and how they resolve it , is what gives this film its bit of magic . the film takes us into bree's world of pimps , high-rollers , prostitutes , and drug-addicts , a world klute thinks is pathetic . these scenes were too predictable and offered no real insight into that underground world of prostitution , leaving many dry spells in the thin story line . jane fonda did get into the head of an intelligent call-girl who is searching for answers to her life , enough so she won a best actress oscar for her performance , though i thought she was at times shrill and played the role with too much of a calculated effort . i actually preferred donald sutherland's contrasting role , even though the film wasn't about him , i thought his normalcy was harder to convey than her hipster role . it was a film about conflicts over emotional involvement and independence , whereas i thought fonda could recover more easily from this tragic part of her life than sutherland could . klute was fresh when it came out in the 1970s , but time has taken away much of its boldness . even the semi-nude scenes are very tame by today's standards . 
inspired by a pushkin novel , which it considerably watered down , " the eagle " has been adapted to the screen by the sure-handed clarence brown , in a tribute to the kind of adventure story douglas fairbanks popularized in his silent 1922 robin hood film and in his zorro role in 1920 the mark of zorro . this film is a tale of adventure , romance , and intrigue , with a good deal of tongue-in-cheek comedy thrown in to help the predictable story out . it was a very popular film in its time . this , his penultimate film , is a good example of how his mannered acting and striking latin looks , made him a ladies favorite . the film also has the great art designer , william cameron menzies , do its breathtaking sets . carl davis does the musical arrangements in the updated film version , adding the russian touch to the ongoing screen action , with music by tchaikovsky , rimski-korsakoff , and prokofiev . the film was set in the 18th century , but the costumes were from more modern times . valentino is dashing in the role , but it is difficult to see what made him so popular from this movie . i feel the same way about james dean when i see his films . but there must have been something beyond what was seen onscreen to explain his tremendous appeal . this satisfying film is a good one to determine for yourself what there is about him that had his lady fans swoon over him . it is a large-scale picture , giving him a chance to do both action and romantic scenes , the kind of serious acting he wasn't asked to do in his previous films . 
brian de palma is a commercial filmmaker who imitates other noted filmmakers but has not met with the same artistic success as a hitchcock or a coppola , ones he in particular gravitates towards ; but , by adding his own brand of sleek cinematography and gratuitous violent action scenes to jazz his films up , he at least salvages some identity of his own . but what antonioni does , is make you wish to penetrate his film , he makes you think about what you are seeing . coppola will challenge you to have a political view of what you are seeing . their films are so well-received as art films because they go beneath the surface of things , they have something to say . while de palma's films are all surface vehicles , there is nothing to think about . his films are pretty to look at and are good at simulating what an art film is , but they are more interested in being entertaining than anything else . therefore , even if " blow out " pretends to be like the above mentioned films , it is in style only . this film will prove itself in the end to be without sufficient weight to be put in the heavyweight class . it's mired in the lightweight class , working as an effective film mostly because it has a sense of humor and travolta is convincing as the unlikely hero fighting against political corruption . the running gag is that he needs a perfect scream for his current film , a psycho-like one , with a shower slashing scene , and the actresses auditioned can't give a realistic one . you can guess where he gets a perfect realistic scream by the film's conclusion . this is an obvious reference to teddy kennedy's chappaquidick political scandal . the film was taut and exciting to this point , but there are several breakdowns in the story , as it veers into the slasher film mode . de palma has moved solidly into mundane territory , jettisoning ideas in favor of high-tech shots and thrilling action scenes . " blow out " has moved into the range of the unbelievable horror films , worrying more about special effects than about having an intelligent story . this was not the gloomy theme the public wanted to see , as " blow out " was never popular in its day . it had received mixed reviews from the major film critics at the time , but the film , even though it was an uneven one , has caught the attention of some current film critics and film buffs , and is now established as a cult-favorite . i thought it was limited in scope but because of the flashy camerawork , the fine performances by both travolta ( his first major starring role ) and lithgow , and the many thrills it provided , it was easy to watch and just as easy to put out of my mind . 
the moody atmospheric film moves at a snail's pace , giving me the impression that it is about to say something important , but everything turns out to lead forlornly down a dead-end . also , the main characters are not the nicest of people , making it difficult to sympathize with them . it could be said that this was one of the director's more trying melodramatic efforts , except for the stylish photography and the use of mediterranean shades of yellow , orange and brown for its outside shots , and for the indoor shots of the many rooms it shows , there are various shades of blue , to give the film a pleasing artistic look . for antonioni , contrast is the main thing to show about life : as sometimes things go good , sometimes things go rotten . the story , the dialogue , the characters , and the pace of the film are done in such a lethargic way , that it radically diminishes the love story . even the sex , which was plentiful , is carried out in such an unenthusiastic way , that it wasn't erotic . yet , what gives the film a certain sense of elegance , underlying its ennui , is that the director is aiming all his guns at being thematic . this is a film that could only expect to be well-received by a receptive intellectual audience of antonioni film buffs , who have the patience and understanding to embrace its arcane premises , vexing story , and the litany of existential themes the director is prone to . niccolo is anxious to find out who she knew that might be doing this , but his search is done in such a half-hearted way , that it creates little tension . the film's main purpose is not the story or the mystery , but in showing the difficulty it is to have a successful relationship in these civilized times . everyone's life seems to be too complicated to just love each other without finding other reasons to either breakup or stay together . the film goes out of its way to show how alienated and isolated the main characters are : mavi and niccolo are driving in a fog that is so thick one can't see anything , as they get lost for awhile while walking on the highway ; there are countless shots of doors opening and closing and of serious people talking to each other but not communicating . the only logical thing niccolo can say at the party to mavi is , " do all your parties have this sectarian atmosphere ? therefore , he will make a film that is impossible to digest , about spacemen going to the sun to find out what the source of power means to mankind . it's a film stuck on ideas and many metaphors , but they are dragged around by a static story , trying too hard to show how negative and cold the world has become . the film is not helped by having its central character being such a selfish and uncaring dolt , while pretending to be an intellectual . most of the warmth in the film came from the photography , which is not enough of a reason for me to get over how vacant the story felt . yet , it is a film from the master director antonioni , covering his favorite theme of alienation , and he is someone whose poorer films are still worth seeing , as there is always some nugget to be found . the nugget i found , is that the director is suggesting that in this " age of alienation , " it is more fun and realistic to make a childlike fantasy film than an idealized love story . 
she is also seen in a bold light offering her impulsive opinions about anything , which sometimes are so blunt that they hit the mark , whereas a more educated person might not have been able to say what she did in such an offhand manner and gotten away with it . what this film has going for it , are its originality of story line , the brashness of the star and of the 35-year-old mexican director , carlos marcovich , and the unpredictability of where the film is going . the problem i had with it is , at times , i lost interest in the flighty story . this film closely resembles what a free-spirited college student could do on a videocam , though here every scene looks beautifully shot and all the improvisationals have an air of professionalism about them . but i wouldn't go overboard in praising the brashness of the film , as it seems to be based on very low expectations for what a movie should be about . its entertainment values are easily met by the overall zestiness of the film and its zany characterizations , which give the film a look of rebellion ; but , its failure to uncover an interesting story or have characters with more mature views , makes this film seem flimsy . she replies , " i didn't know you'd be so ugly . " the film is loose and brash , filled with youthful exuberance and energy ; it constantly introduces peripheral characters , such as neighbors , relatives , and casual acquaintances , into the story , who add a cartoonish flavor to it . but the film is too scattered to mean much . it resonates only in flashes , as scenes change on the go before anything could be developed . this real-life look at yuliet took place in the years from 1995-1997 . her story has some merits . . . if the film's superficiality doesn't get under your skin . i would have to say that he won , getting away with a very slight film that is full of energy thanks to the veracity of yuliet's performance and the hectic rhythmical ways he filmed the story , which gives the film its poetical strength . 
lars von trier ( breaking the waves/the idiots ) , one of the danish founders of dogme '95 , that gimmicky method of filming only with certain sparse cimematic rules , creates this film in drab digital video and with a hand-held camera . he has the flair for showbiz promoting , and has created a film that pulls every string in the book hollywood wrote about making tearjerkers , but without the love for those musicals that a jacques demy had when he revitalized the hollywood musical with his brilliant " umbrella's of cherbourg . " this film is a captivating love it or hate it musical melodrama , one that should divide its audience to either pole , that unfairly pulls cards out of its sleeve to make sure its case against the death penalty can't lose . the story's heroine is played by icelandic pop singer-composer bjork , who won the best actress prize at the recent cannes film festival , with childlike simplicity and unbelievable dumbness on her part , allowing her character to lack depth . the film won the prestigious palme d'or for best picture . praise from abroad for this film has been far greater than the less than warm reaction its has gotten from most film critics in the states . that scene was a typical contrived one that von trier uses , throwing it in the viewer's face that everything about this film is shamelessly rigged and there's nothing you can do about it . i got the feeling , that if you don't accept his world-socialist view of things , you are made to feel like you are on the wrong side . then the most startling thing about this so far very manipulative and dull story takes place , flighty song and dance numbers break out everywhere among the characters , as fantasy and reality get intermeshed , and original songs written and performed by bjork and inventively choreographed by vincent paterson are acted out -- where some numbers take place in the factory , the rehearsal hall , a railroad bridge and the courtroom . these numbers were hardly memorable , but they were attention getting since they didn't fit the action and had a bizarre look to them . what they all had was a verve , like something important was happening , rather than the songs and dances being good music . yet there was something about this break in the story line that interrupted the boredom of the story and gave the film renewed life . it was the only time the film wasn't dried out by the manipulative story and seemed like a true cinematic fantasy experience . it was the only thing in the film that seemed to be innovative and chancy , as for once the director stopped exploiting the poor dumb woman for a brief respite , before carrying on with making her into a martyr . i don't think the director made his point that well against the death sentence by making the trial and her death such a blatant mockery . all those scenes were obviously phony , a set-up for the director to force his beliefs down the viewer's throats . everything about this film was unreal and embedded with such an effete snobbishness to show only its view was the right one about how the system works . it seems as if von trier is , as always , the ego-driven publicist and never the artist first and he is always seeking to gain attention for his views about society , without giving me the sense that he really cares about what he is railing against . i never for one moment in this film thought he cared about selma's suffering , her blindness , or that he viewed any of the workers with real understanding . his point of how economic conditions makes one a murderer seemed too simple a generalization to take seriously . it also seems to me that he used the hanging only because without it he couldn't finish the job he had of exploiting her suffering to the extreme . billy wilder in his " double indemnity " didn't have to use the electric chair to get across his point about how the justice system operates , neither was it used by tay garnett in his superior 1946 " the postman always rings twice . " both films in their earnest telling of a real story , make a better argument than von trier does against capital punishment , even though he uses every heart-tugging trick there is to make his case . he does this because what he really believes , is that he must shock an audience in order for his film to work , he doesn't seem to be able to operate in any other way . the best i can say for him about this film , was that as trying as it was to watch it and as difficult as it was not to feel exploited by the story , his film had a quality about it that kept connecting with so many things that are interesting , that despite the dullness of the film and despite my resentment at his methods of filming , i was still enthralled about the film . but i have come to think of him now , after watching his film career evolve , as less of an artist and more of a showman . they speak english in this film , but the film doesn't feel like an american one . it has the static energy of a film made in communist czechoslovakia . von trier has never been to america and most of the actors in this film are foreigners , and the story is not a very believable presentation of america and how its judicial system works , unless you want to take extreme cases as the rule . with this film , he is the one dancing in the darkness , but brazen enough to give one the impression that he is re-inventing cinema . i take him for a charming huckster , with enough vitality in his films to pull the hustle off . i just don't trust him as a filmmaker . this is the most exploitive and least riskiest film he has made to date , in my humble opinion . the only risk he took in this film , is that he would torture the viewer to death by all his contrivances and the brutally slow-pace of the film , and by the song lyrics being so empty a gesture to hollywood , and therefore there is the possibility of him not making the 'big bucks' he envisioned by bringing his act to america . 
a fine sequel to the 1956 " the curse of frankenstein . " there is some additional hokum about the new person becoming a cannibal , if his brain does not heal properly after the operation . this theme is what sustains the b- film with a deeper meaning to the frankenstein myth and keeps him from being a one-dimensional villain . but , overall , there was a staid quality about the film that kept it from being as gripping as it could have been . needless to say , the film was hardly believable , as everything about it was disputable . yet it was entertaining and the cast did a good job , all things considered . 
director-writer andrew l . stone keeps the terse story tense despite the almost certain proof the murder suspect is indeed the guilty one , but he leaves open that it is not absolutely certain until the climactic scene . at first , cameron is reluctant to believe that the very loving , prim and pretty lynne is capable of murder . this is a well-acted thriller and it is directed with some nice touches , as when cotten is romancing her on the deck and a door opens to a burst of laughter from some ship party goers . at that point the air went out of cotten , as he thought maybe it wasn't murder , but the druggist made an honest mistake , after all these kind of accidents happen all the time . 
he is burdened with an unbelievable melodramatic story and the dullish performance of his femme fatale co-star , faith domergue , as the alluring margo lannington , two obstacles that are difficult to overcome . faith is the gorgeous protege of studio boss howard hughes , and makes her inauspicious film debut here . this is a film that is always enticing but could have been much better served with a different femme fatale playing faith's part . it was beautifully photographed by nick musuraca in the dark b&w style of noir and so ably directed by john farrow , who successfully caught the nightmarish visions of the tale . it is interesting mostly as a character study of a capable man blinded by lust whose life is almost destroyed . mitchum's convincing portrayal of the innocent man on the run , is what makes the soap opera story more compelling than it ought to be . spoiler to follow : proceed to last paragraph if you don't want to know the ending . the movie plays like a noir clich ? . but mitchum saves the day , realistically showing how a swell guy and such a competent doctor could be so vulnerable . claude rains as always is magnificent , in a small part but one where his every gesture seems to be constrained in a maniacal rage ready to burst open . 
this tearjerker melodrama proved to be a big hit commercially for the popular silent star mary pickford . there is one scene where they both are together , and this was accomplished by the method of double-exposure . skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to know how the story is resolved . undoubtedly , the film is dated , but for its time and the excellent way the film was crafted , it succeeds as a popular soap opera type of vehicle . though , by having pickford , " america's sweetheart , " commit a murder , its ethics and reasons for doing so can certainly be questioned , though the happy ending satisfied the public . many film critics felt that this was the best role that pickford ever had . though the film was as heavy as goo , it was not without some passing interest for mainly historical reasons . 
a rehashed formula action/sci-fi film about the near future that looks old hat and plays like low-brow entertainment even as it advances the sophisticated problems cloning might eventually hold . maybe it's because the film tried to be both preachy about its social conscience message and at the same time your typical arnold schwarzenegger action film , that it looked so confused , seeming as fuzzy and as unbelievable as the instant cloning process it featured in the film . but , as for the film's entertainment value , it passes the test for mild escapist fare , and to the bargain you have two arnold's saying lame one-liners for the price of one . but , even if this film is not as good as his " total recall " or " true lies " or even " terminator 2 , " it should be good enough to be accepted by his loyal following . how it will do in the box office and with the general public , is hard to say , as the film seems gloomily cluttered with nocturnal shots and the action is less than spectacular , and it is not as stylish as some other recent popular action films ( eg . and , how the public will respond to the aging arnold saving the world from an evil clone manufacturer who is merely a greedy businessman and not a super-villain , in a pg-13 film without an edge , is anyone's guess , especially since arnold's popularity is slipping . in this film he is asked to carry the load , though helped somewhat that the film is well executed , has good enough special effects and a semi-plausible cloning theme . but , he still cannot overcome the overall mediocrity of the film . for its thought provoking moments , the film wants to draw its battlelines over good science vs . bad science , showing how drucker's corporation greedily makes money off science and profits greatly from its illegal operation . philosophy is not one of the film's strong points , as there is a muddled argument for each position presented . for him , there is nothing higher than human love . he's the most interesting one in the film , so it behooves me that he has a truncated part , which fails to give him the depth needed to draw out his character and go further than the drab figure he is portrayed as , being a good scientist used by an evil businessman . " we have a lifetime contract with a vegetable . the joke being , that you don't have to die , the corporation can clone you in no time at all ( hardly believable ) , if they have your genetic code , and the cost is a only mere one and a half million bucks . it's all been seen before , but the film seems easy to take or leave , and is only mildly offensive to both those who like their films with a bit more intelligence and those who prefer a lot more rough action . this film will live and die not by its story , but by what you think of its action scenes . i thought they were good enough in a functional sense , but there were just too many dead spots in the story for me to find this big-budget film anything more than a minor work . 
but lugosi couldn't pull it off being a surgeon and ends up in a minor part as the gangster marnay . the gangster red cannon sustains paralysing spinal injuries and is taken to the same hospital as kingsley . " black friday " was fast-paced , had a good cast , and had an interesting story but it could have probably been more interesting if the story wasn't so convoluted . it's a thriller that could have used a few more thrills , suffering mostly from the flat way it was directed . the results are a mixed bag , but there's enough entertainment to be gotten from this b-film , to make it a satisfying watch . 
an above-par courtroom drama , set in los angeles , elevated by director/screenwriter clifford odets' sharp script . he originally intended for this work to be a play . it was also elevated by an outstanding cast , with special kudos to rita hayworth's warm portrayal of a woman in an abusive marriage and by sanford meisner's forceful and expressive performance as the cross-examing prosecutor . the beauty in the film is in the long-drawn-out courtroom dramatics . the story itself wasn't too interesting , but the performances were energetic and the film had a good courtroom style , enough to make this chatty film well worth seeing . 
an alluring biopic about the provocative comedian andy kaufman that couldn't go futher than to provide an entertaining look at the entertainer . if one was looking to find out who andy kaufman was , this film would be of little help . the point of the film being that there was probably no difference between the performer and the person off-stage , therefore it believes by telling the story through only his performances should give one a good enough idea of who andy was . the kaufman role was tailor-made for jim carrey and he comes through with flying colors in a virtuoso performance , as this fictionalized biography of kaufman , shows his odd personality , obsessions , and mind-set . the film seemed flat in the parts when carrey wasn't performing and his story seemed superficial . i didn't feel as if i knew him any better because of this film than i did before , though , at least , the film didn't try to answer something it couldn't . but " man on the moon " was entertaining , even for someone like me who has never been impressed by his comic talents . i am andy . " this might be the way it happened , but it made for bad cinema since he wasn't seen as being funny and his immediate rise to fame lacked credibility as it was filmed , even though we know it evidently did happen . the heart of the film and indeed what keeps it lively , is watching carrey go through his repertoire in a flawless comic manner . milos forman's uneven film is missing the true craziness of kaufman in the entirety of the story . he gets that ingredient not from the conventional way he tells the story but only from jim carrey's expressive performance , as the film went from bursts of great energy with carrey doing andy to dullness in storytelling . her part was so underwritten that there weren't even hints of where the romance or sex in it was , and there appeared to be no intimacy between them . she just seemed to be andy's prop , who looks delicious on the screen but was given nothing to do , but one turn on the wrestling mat . i can't help thinking , that aside from carrey's masterful performance , there's not much in this film to take away with you . the film seems to be an unadultered homage to kaufman , looking on the rosy side of his lunacy and not getting at anything else . kaufman seemed to always be searching for something , whether in studying transcendental meditation , looking for a psychic cure for cancer in the philippines , or a way to push the limits of comedy to a further degree , and what we see in the film , is that he never quite found what he was looking for , in a career that was far too short for a man of his energies and stated talents . 
a quintessential noir film , more entertaining and atmospheric than essential viewing , featuring a hard-boiled story , average though it may be , which goes beyond the main character getting killed in the first reel to spend the rest of the film examining why he lost interest in living anymore . there is also the recognizable cinematography of this genre , which is darkly shot , using shadows to frame its shots , long close-ups to show fear and to overall create a mood for what has become known in film lore as the noir world . and swede , while lying in bed in a darkened room replies , " i did something wrong . . . the film is more or less a pessimistic reaction to the post-war period and of the greed and lust that blinded those who typify the kind of characters who dwell in the noir world , a place where corruption is the norm . it should also be noted that miklos rozsa's musical score was later used by dragnet . 
a depiction of hell , resulting in a messy , sweeping political picture set in 1995 , where all the action takes place on a 12 degree winter night in belgrade , showing a breakdown in 'law and order . ' it was brutal to watch , more intense and more in your face than more recent films on serbia , one that had no subtlety or artistic edge , as the gruesome little scenes ran together in a heavy-handed manner and no voice of reason emerged , or no one to sympathize could be found , except for the all too obvious loss of overall humanity that was pictured . there isn't , unfortunately , one thing to take away from this film that could help you understand the situation better , except to truly see the hopelessness of the situation , and one could have gotten that from reading the newspapers . it's the kind of film that might have a greater impact in the homeland ( which it did ) than throughout the world , as it gives the people of belgrade a chance to look in the mirror and see what they look like to the rest of the world . this is something that could happen in the states , but not likely to this extreme because more than likely the police would have resolved it . probably the most violent sketch , in a film that was a total gross-out ( and i couldn't argue if you chose another scene as more sadistic ) , is the one between two longtime friends sparring at a gym . this serves as a perfect metaphor for what the director is saying about the current thugs running the country . the film had a raw power to it which cannot be denied , but that power was also the film's main fault , as everything about it was just too obvious and too bleak , it couldn't stop showing a country that seemed to have lost every ounce of its humanity , making every character out to be either a loser or a sadist -- probably not unlike president milosevic and his constituents . the film's theme is simply taken from a quote by one of its characters : " this is a goddamned lousy country ; why would anyone want to come back ? '' that seems to be true from what i have seen , but the question for me , is why would anyone want to see this film ? and , i think the answer is , that in all the brutality shown , it is hard to deny that there is a truth that the film shows . the horrors of that country seem to be an everyday thing , and after seeing this film , one can only feel dazed and revolted by what is going on . but this is not an entertaining film ( i don't consider the film's gallows humor to be entertaining ) and it is not for those who like their war films with good guys they can identify with . . . it's a message film , saying these kind of horrors happened many times in history before and they will continue to happen if we forget history . i have no problem that the film wasn't entertaining , my problem with the film was that it wasn't informative about the human condition in a way that wasn't so obvious and in a way that could involve the viewer more with its characters . 
a stunningly original film , but one that is hardly plausible . yes . it is entertaining to a certain degree . the terror seemed more theatrical than real inner angst , which took away from the film's tense scenes . the film's theme , a recurring one in filmmaker cronenberg's repertoire -- of an unhappy body in a palace revolt -- suggests in no uncertain terms that dreams can kill . . . and that anger if unchecked is something that takes its toll on the individual and on others . this transference method is called " psychoplasmics . " the story proceeds on an erratic course of mixing gore and shock with cerebral challenges , never establishing which one it is more commmitted to , as the story moves too far adrift to maintain a credible suspense . instead it relies on the intense performance of oliver reed , as the so-called genius experimenter who lost track of right and wrong , to pull you into the politics of what the film is saying about ethical medicine and the implications it has for the patients and society . i say . . . there's it's a film that could easily be viewed as being about a bad marriage and an even uglier separation , in other words a domestic drama with the trappings of a horror film . while throwing out a lot of nauseating sights and many themes , the film failed to hold together to make this a solid effort , but if viewed for its parts rather than its sum , it had some very strong scenes of relating one's body problems to the constraints of the mind . in any case , it's more cerebral than the usual special-effect horror film and is worth seeing for its uniqueness . 
for those who love the following in their horror tales : schlock , an old-fashioned grand guignol story , and a hammy performance from its star , it should be noted that this film has all that . well . . . you the film was atmospheric -- plenty of cobwebs , dark corners , and ghoulish creatures around to add to the eerie tale . i suppose it was chilling enough but it still lacked that missing magical ingredient to make this a more satisfying film . i think the problem was that the story dragged after the exciting opening scene and never could pick up steam again . this turns out to be a minor film from roger corman's oeuvre , not up to his other more daringly told horror tales . . . yet , it is enjoyable in a goofy sort of way . 
a cute family drama/comedy about destiny and the choices one makes . this indie film is set in chicago , comparing the protagonist's working-class background in the produce market with the high culture of the opera world he rejected . but . . . the george seems in a rut . . . not her managers have a divided opinion about giving george a shot at singing something spontaneously in her show , but she sides with giving him a chance , as she aims to make opera more accessible to the public and not to be only for the purists . the film ultimately is about whom does she love more -- the artist or the prominent politician . i bet you can guess who wins ! this was a likable but not a particularly moving tale . the characters were pleasing , but no more . the situation they were in seemed realistic , and the way they handled themselves gave the film its comedy sparks . but what the film was missing , was sparks from the romance . what the film also lacked was a more telling story and a bit more tension . it seemed to be played too loose and easy , as if the problems that come his way were part of the problems one would expect to find in any sitcom . nevertheless , i loved the atmosphere the film created -- of mixing the stock workingman types with the stock opera types , and with george cutting a nifty path to his destiny between his two chosen fields of endeavor . as for the opera singing -- let me shout from the rafters , bravo ! ! ! 
when you can't get sissy spacek to be your star and you get porn star marilyn chambers instead , things should become sexier . chambers is fine as rose , even though her sexual abilities are put under constraints by the conservative nature of the script . the side effect that occurs is freaky indeed -- she develops a fanged phallus under her armpit . he has some fun with this theme , taking on the subject matter with mock seriousness , showing a series of attacks caused by marilyn . there is also an incident in the porno theater , which could have been funnier . the film ably depicts the city in a panic and shows the victims foaming at the mouth , reduced to madness . these scenes are mostly played for shock value , but have a certain sophisticated humor about them and relate a concern about medical procedures , alerting us to the fact that doctors have the power to do just about anything to their patients . one of film's main faults , is that it offered no characters that we could care about , but it instead developed an offbeat story that had some kind of political message hidden in its humor . it was quite enjoyable in a less than biting way . 
party ( director/writer : manoel de oliveira ; screenwriter : agustina bessa-luis ; cinematographer : renato berta ; editor : valerie loiseleux ; cast : michel piccoli ( michel ) , irene papas ( irene ) , leonor silveira ( leonor ) , rogerio samora ( rogerio ) ; runtime : 95 ; gemini films / madragoa filmes ; 1996-portugal / france ) the couple are shown to be avid collectors who like to pretend they care about culture but really have these objects only to impress others . she explains the absurdity of the world by saying , " the world belongs to lunatics like hitler and mussolini -- there're the ones who are most noticeable . " there's a surprise ending , which nicely resolves this little love conundrum . the film appeals to the intellect to answer its questions about love , but fails to be appealing emotionally . it was just too chatty and the characters always seemed to be symbols , too unapproachable to be considered as real people . but i'm a big fan of michel piccoli and irene papas , and i found their performances to be very stimulating--which is reason enough to see this art house film . 
a superficial but entertaining roller-coaster-ride of nonstop action featuring clich ? characters and contrived dangerous situations , mainly conceived to show off the special effects . the story is so slight that there is no danger of it interfering with the action scenes . it's a hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment . the reward will be a visual treat of well-executed stunts and a film that had the glossy look of a national geographic photography shoot . movie viewers could go snowblind just watching a series of mountain catastrophes befall the adventurous climbers , as the film throws out almost any possible danger there is to be found on a mountain and the mountain climbers try to overcome these impossible obstacles and , there is , needlessly to say , a race-against-time sequence , with a last second rescue in the works . the opening eight-minute scene , derivative as it is , is brilliantly done and captures whatever underlying tension the film was to later on build up to . she is still upset with what peter did and could hardly face him , much less talk to him about it . the commercial motive for the climb and the callous way he will soon treat his fellow climbers , makes him the film's designated one-dimensional villain , and adds some more spice to a film that is overspiced already with clich ? s . the rescuers will try to blast the victims out of the cavern , but must be very careful when climbing because with just one spill of the explosive liquid there is the certainty of a tremendous explosion . there will be many tremendous explosions that rock the himalayas , and -- if mountains repeatedly exploding and climbers falling down mountain peaks in colorful ways is your idea of enjoyment , then this is the film for you . the action keeps coming , the clich ? s get resolved somehow , and even though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real , the great photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this world . the filmmaker used the southern alps in new zealand as his setting , and you could have fooled me , because it sure looked like the himalayas . it also looked like it could be a long commercial for beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for club med , or a national geographic tv special , or even one of those action thrillers that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy story . 
it is richly adapted from a jeffrey eugenides novel by director sofia coppola . the film is an evocative visual depiction of a typical suburban family and community . it dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive girls's smiling faces , leaving one with a lingering feeling of helplessness about their situation . adolescence is scrutinized by sofia coppola in a cinematically crafted manner , finely inspired by what we think we remember about that age when looking back at it , with the implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than the other way around . the boys , except for one , are insecure and clumsy around the girls . edward lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it , as he seems to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy , which complements a story that can't be completely put together because we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did . despite liking much about the film and respecting the eclectic approach the director used , i still found that this film wasn't talking to me . i felt i was asked to be a mourner at a once in a lifetime story that has the possibility to pop up some day on the tv news as one of those bizarre events that just happen without cause , but the story itself went no deeper than how the tv news would cover it . the exploration of the teens in their growing pains , their ordinary wants , and even in their grandeur , left me scratching my head at this allegorical tale , wondering how it was that the sunshine couldn't get inside them , why they were symbolically cut down in life like the diseased elm tree in front of their house was , where i could at least see the disease in the tree's yellow leaves . i don't know how much of their futility i could see , as the more i thought about them , the more they seemed like ghosts than real people , and they all started looking like each other , so i couldn't distinguish one from the other , except for lux , who for some reason in all her boldness and sexuality , couldn't find the strength to live . which left me perplexed as to why the film thrived on not telling a complete story . if i tried to know more about the girls , i would only become like the shrink , giving off pat answers to something that was supposed to remain a mystery . i don't know if this is a good or a bad way for a film to leave the viewer , but i do know i felt something profound was missing here , as the film was more revealing about the boys and their idealization of the girls than it was about the girls and what they were really like . this seemed misplaced storytelling , since the girls' story should have been more compelling than the boys' awkward adolescent tale was . what saves this film , is the innovative way the director filmed the story , covering up the fluff to make the story look deeper than it was . 
crime wave ( director : andr ? de toth ; screenwriters : from a story by john & ward hawkins/crane wilbur/bernard gordon/richard e . wormser ; cinematographer : bert glennon ; editor : thomas reilly ; cast : sterling hayden ( lt . it is noteworthy for its great b&w location shots of the busy l . a . streets and of capturing a noir look of alienation . andr ? de toth only directed one other noir film , pitfall ( 48 ) . one of the film's pleasures is in the offhand gestures it makes to sim's quirks . this low-budget b-flick was very entertaining . it has a fast-pace , a good eye for detail , and some vivid camera shots around los angeles , which made for a tough looking film . 
a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal environment . 
it's a decidedly corny and manipulative coming-of-age film that never quite grabbed my attention , but it was sure pleasant enough in a surface way , telling an old-fashioned story that carefully skirts any controversy . he says he took a job as an accountant so he would be sitting at work and people wouldn't notice that he walks with a limp . the coming-of-age messages in this film are presented in a low-key manner , as they reflect on a number of things seen through the childish eyes of willie , such as the pains of war , the disappointments of hero worship , the importance of friendship and loyalty , the thrill of puppy love , the necessity for community pride , the need for parental love and racial tolerance , and his overall fond memories of childhood . in a formulaic scene using every ounce of its energy to tear at the viewer's heart , skip wakes up after a life-saving operation , as an immense relief comes over the face of willie . the film should be enjoyed by children of all ages , as the dog steals the picture with his antics and spinning tricks and playful ways . adults might be taken in by a sense of nostalgia , about seeing an idealized childhood they might have had or wished for . those who grew up having a dog as a pet , should respond with approval about how much fun it was to have a dog . for the film to be better received , it would have needed more drama . but , as it is , it is good enough as a plain old-fashioned story about the love affair between an introspective youngster and his loving dog . muniz made for an appealing youngster , skip stole every scene he was in , and the understated and elegant performances by both bacon and lane , gave the film some life . if you're in the mood for a lighthearted boy-dog story and are not looking for anything deeper than that , then " my dog skip " will jump right up on your lap and lick your face . 
it is a darkly violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging , but has its brief moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the union victory meant for the country . but the film could not present a coherent plot , as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its colorful battle scenes . taking the southern side , the film found humor in the awkward situations presented and found beauty in the landscape photographed , and reasons in the southern cause which doomed them to failure . but many things about the film seemed to be perfunctory and more like a costume show where the soldiers were more interested in showing off the plumage on their cowboy hats than in giving a dramatic presentation . this explains a key weakness of the southern cause , according to the filmmaker , that the southern values are tradition-bound and part of a static culture . they have been spending their time having longwinded unnatural conversations that sound much like sermons , so sue lee's intrusion is more than welcome at this time . though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way , yet the presentation of the story didn't seem to always jell . it was a dull film , the acting was misplaced , the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted . it never got around to being an entertaining film , and it could never be perceived as just an informative film , because it could never quite spit out what it was trying to say . i also found tobey maguire's performance grimacing to take--this was the wrong part and film for him to go through his innocent contortions that he has done in all his previous films . 
david lynch's lost highway , his first feature film after five years , is a surreal thriller with a puzzling plot , that asks a lot from the viewer , as far as accepting this far-fetched tale on face value . it's meant to be a non-conventional film , a shocker , an attempt at post-modern noir , an avant-garde sci-fi ghost story that is stylish and engrossing , but what it mostly is , is a confusing film that tries to be weirder than his eraserhead and blue velvet films , but is too outlandish to be compared with those superior features . it also smacks of being pretentious , of putting down the characters in nonhuman terms , as if they are so unimportant that they can easily be reincarnated to appear as someone else , without any explanation being given . it was a cold story , seemingly with psychological undertones about multiple-personality disorders that stretches logic to the breaking point . but it held my attention throughout and concludes with a roller-coast ride down a dark , desolate highway , with an ending that does little to give meaning to the puzzle . but it does complete its narrative by tieing up the loose ends of what the characters were plotting and it keeps intact its pessimistic mood . it sounded like this is something that could have been said in an adult version of an 'amos and andy' sketch . lynch then goes into exploiting his usual themes of violence , gore and dubious sexual situations and we also get to see arquette stroll around in her underwear , when she's not completely nude . she was the least interesting of all the characters , partly because of her insipid performance and partly because the two characters she played were not particularly interesting . i'm not exactly clear what it means , but a lot of things in this film serve as doubles , including the couple's house which is a double for the lost highway hotel , where some heavy-duty action takes place in the film's concluding moments . both bill pullman and balthazar getty are effective in their roles , as they both seem to be acting in a low-key mode . while the loggia role was too predictably gangsterish and seen too often in recent films to bring much to the table here ( it was second-rate in maniacal comic-viciousness compared to hopper's same type of role in blue velvet ) . the movie was somewhat effective not because of the actors or the story , but because it was elusive , atmospheric , unpredictable , different in form , and gracefully ethereal . it was a film that took chances , resulting in an uneven work , but in its dark moments was able to shine as a haunting film . if one wishes to make sense of this film , it would have to be done on a metaphorical level , and it would take dismissing logic and loving a film that relishes in its darkness and obscurity . 
it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it . 
a big , loopy , overlong , dullish docudrama-style thriller , about the losing battle of the 'war on drugs . ' it is at times more preachy than dramatic , taking the point of view that something has to be done about the drug situation but not saying what , only that what's been tried has not worked and the youth of america are being unduly harmed by drugs . there's nothing new presented here : same old answers , same old film , but this one takes itself more serious because of the talented cast and the formulaic way this story was adapted from a simon moore work , which was scripted by stephen gaghan and directed with precision but in an uninspiring way by steven soderbergh . it first ran as a mini-series on british tv in 1989 , a medium it probably would be the most logical place to view this updated ambitious version . once all the stories are in place , the film shows how human frailty plays a part in the corruption of various individuals . manolo succumbs to being bribed by the drug lords as he is overwhelmed by the money he sees passing hands and does something he would never have done , if not tempted . the film wraps up neatly , tieing up all the tragic ongoing drug war stories . so he asks out loud , how can you wage a war against your own family ? the film soft pedals any advocacy for legalizing drugs and offers no hard-hitting critique of current policies , except to say it doesn't work . it seems to have safely placed itself in the middle of the argument , not taking sides ( a rather wishy-washy way to leave things ) . i don't know what could be said , other than this was a competently made film , the actors were forceful in their roles , with the plucky performance by the conflicted cop benicio del toro outshining the others , and for some comic relief , there was some amusing dialogue between cheadle and guzman . the film had a nice look to it , as cinematographer soderbergh aka peter andrews , has given the film a look of urgency , using a handheld camera , and working with different tinctures of desertlike yellow-orange shades and icy blue lighting to get a better view of his subjects and their hard-boiled tale . 
the production also changed screenwriters , as david mamet's script was rejected and his script was replaced by steven zaillian's . the film is stylistically pleasing to the eye . its serial killer scenes are excessive , but they do allow for comedy to soften the blows and , also , since all the victims were not particularly nice people , watching them being mutilated was made more bearable . the film can be divided into three parts and all with different results . the film's opening is meticulously choreographed , showing in detail how a police bust can go sour . the film's second part taking place in italy , is brilliantly conceived and acted , it is the heart of the film , with its visual effects matching its dialogue and storytelling . though , even this part of the film has its faults , as some scenes will drag on for far too long , allowing a tedium to creep into the story . the last part , when back in the washington , dc area , is a total gross-out , that brings the film down to a mundane campy level , as bad taste takes over , making for a very sloppy and exploitive surprise ending . overall , this sequel didn't live up to the high-pulp-art standards of the original , but it was still successful in being a technically superior cinematic happening and the quality of the acting was always first-rate . hopkins's riveting performance is interlaced with wit and a sense of the genteel , though it also comes with some over-the-top moves ( though there are no slurping tongue sounds when he goes into his cannibalistic mode as in the original ) . the nervous , icy but vulnerable persona that moore ably brought to her role , much like foster played it , keyed in on her fight with male authority figures who can't accept her because she's different than they are , more than with her mental chess game with lecter as in the original . in the climactic scenes , hannibal comes back to the states , and his long-anticipated meeting with clarice takes place -- which turns out to be a fizzle , or a real lame-brained idea on how to put a twist in the plot that becomes unnecessarily twisted . the film , that was faithful to thomas harris' novel until this point , now goes off on ridley scott's own direction and it becomes an absurd mess , with nothing working right , and all its good work is nearly eaten away by the director's bad instincts . what can you say , but sometimes you try something new and it just doesn't taste right . 
a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal materialistic environment . 
this theme has been done better many times before and in a superior way in such films as " shane ( 53 ) " and in clint's own " high plains drifter ( 72 ) . " this film adds little to the genre , except it is a visually stunning film as photographed by bruce surtees and clint's heroics are enjoyable to watch , as he unabashedly brings back many of the western's classic confrontational scenes , such as the showdown on main street and of the helpless man made to dance as the gunslingers fire away at his feet . otherwise , this is a somewhat disappointing venture , not because it isn't well-acted or directed , but because it is so stale that it becomes uninvolving . they are a rough looking bunch of desperadoes , all wearing long dusters , giving the final shootout , a very recognizable western touch . it's a fine film for those who don't mind that hero-worshipping is a good chunk of the plot , and that what was metaphorically hinted at never develops because of the film's awkward presentation . 
it was crisply directed and well acted , and its quick pace fitted nicely into the stylish way this b & w film was presented . 
one character says of the farm , it is in such a remote spot , even the coyotes don't come here . it's a marriage consumed by hate . " deep valley " offers a dramatic look at how love can make one feel alive again . the film comes to a boil with its very moving conclusion , after a very slow start . the acting is first-rate , making these melodramatics seem realistic . 
zhang yang's bittersweet dramatic comedy , " shower , " is meant to be a crowd pleaser . its manipulative and sugary story is set in modern beijing . why he didn't phone is a mystery to me , since he doesn't seem to go anywhere without his cell phone . the film's more serious message , is of the family's estranged relationship . the director zhang yang has created a graceful , masculine film ( all the main characters are male and the story is told from their view ) , avoiding for the most part the sentimentality that could have sunk the film , if handled by a lesser director . this mainstream , middle-brow , foreign film was the winner of audience awards at festivals at rotterdam and all over europe and asia , which means it clicked with varous audiences because of its universal appeal . though , i thought , to make his point about the old and new china , he pulled out too many old contrived tricks out of the hat , from the bathhouse being torn down and replaced by a shopping mall , to a retarded brother stealing the film with his comical and good-natured appeal . yet what i found to be outright fascinating , was the strong relationship between the wonderfully benevolent zhu xu ( the king of masks ) , an actor who has a certain magical screen presence , and the gifted actor who played his retarded son , jiang wu , and the equally gifted actor pu cun xin who as the older son , was used by the director to signify how well the transition was going in china from the old to the new . but what interested me most about shower , is that it gave me a chance to observe everyday life in a country that has been closed to the west , and the film has done it in a most endearing way . other than that , i still found the story too sweet for my taste . 
and , even though , he is told that the hamam is now out of fashion and the one he has inherited needs lots of repairs , he decides to remain and restore it to its traditional beauty . it was a strange emotional love affair that this film offers its protagonists -- a love affair with a city rather than with another . the film presents a lesson on the old and new cultures of both italy and turkey . but for a film about passion , this one was very reserved , showing no nudity or sensual scenes , in fact very little passion . 
a fairly routine contemporary western , which was originally shot in 3-d , but was later re-released without that gimmick . if you ever wanted to see both a rodeo and a movie together , now is your chance . under richard fleischer's capable direction , the film does a marvelous job of capturing the realistic flavor of being around rodeo performers . but the love story is rather sappy , and the point about how dangerous the rodeo is , especially for those who get older and can't stop performing , seemed too melodramatic . nevertheless , the film thrived on the very good performances by gig young and the supporting cast , especially by harry morgan . it was able to film an entire rodeo event in tuscon , arizona , in almost real time . it is basically a soap-opera version of nicholas ray's much superior " the lusty men " ( 1952 ) . there is good comraderie among the riders , featuring friendly rivalries , but there are also occasions for spats . 
it plays more like a theatrical ghost story or a greek tragedy than a western . tantoo cardinal has a minor part , even though the film is theoretically about her , as the film's title states . it's a film that revels in a dark brooding mystical flavor and of being a revisionist-type of a western rather than one of those traditional oaters . unfortunately , the film never held together in a cohesive way , and seemed forced and awkward at times . it should satisfy mostly those who are in need to see something different , something that is cultish and attuned to sam shephard's penchant for showing dysfunctional families . 
naturally , coming from them , it is a very loose interpretation of that greek classic . this film even gets its title from the part in sullivan's travels when joel mccrea , playing a successful director , wants to stop doing comedy to make instead a serious socially conscious drama called `o brother , where art thou ? ' the film will display moments of visual splendor and a riot of comedy coming about through the characterization of the three stooge-like convicts , but overall the film flags in its effort to make the story more worthy than a few skits that work . the major skit in the film , is a wonderfully choreographed ku klux klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a comical fashion . the film reaches its climactic moment , when they sing in disguise at a political rally and get recognized with a standing ovation by the audience as the soggy bottom boys . the story seemed to die when it tried to conclude in some sane way , as the film was played mostly for the comedy , so the story had no emotional impact or little complexity to it , even though it lightly touched on racial and religious issues . there were also several obvious references to homer's epic , but mostly it was a film carried by the comedy performances of the three dimwitted characters , with george clooney showing he had an old-fashioned charm , much like the old hollywood stars , plus he has a good ear for comedy , and showed that he could carry a film . i was somewhat disappointed by this big mess of a film ( trying to depict the depression-era in the deep south as in the midst of great social changes due to anything from its music to the tva--with comedy being prescribed as a the cureall for everything ) . it was amusing and fun to watch , but could never get over its limitation -- a weak storyline . 
it's a colorful adventure story of saloon brawls , romance , and corruption . the brawl was unrealistic but marvelous to watch . the stellar cast of stars and noted supporting players keep the action rolling , as everyone seems just right for the parts they are playing . marlene couldn't be sexier , wearing brocades and gowns , changing from one gown to another at the drop of a beer stein . for comic moments , there is the dialogue between marlene and black maid marietta canty , who is yearning for a black dude to appear in the yukon . 
a nice premise about the 4th dimension results in an exciting low-budget pulp sci-fi film , which is supported by some fine acting by robert lansing and lee meriwether that gave the film some tension , the only spoiler was some incredulous acting by james congdon , putting a bit of a damper on the film . this b-film also look stilted at times , but was able to go forward with a riveting story and overcome its shortcomings and lackluster special effects ( except for the thrilling walk through the wall ) . as far as i know , there were no winners , but it was fun to see the way some film moguls promoted their films back then . it seems that a year's worth of energy takes place in a second and gives scott this superpower . the crudest line of dialogue in this hokum sci-fier , is a question asked by meriwether to lansing : do you want to be remembered as a creator or a killer ? 
guy ritchie has cleaned up some of the mess he made in this encore to his surprise box-office cult hit " lock , stock and two smoking barrels , " but has made the same kind of empty , semiserious/comedy/crime caper , with many of the same actors from that film . but , this time the story holds together better and is much more amusing , thanks in a large part to the ensemble cast who come and go in the film with seamless fluidity . it's a film filled with an assortment of colorful runyonesque characters from the underworld of crime , or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches , or from the outcasts of society . this film , like the director's other one , has no strong role for a woman . the main plot is about a series of mishaps over a stolen diamond that somehow brings together a varied mix of characters who are after it or are inadvertently drawn into its disappearance , but the plot is really irrelevant , it plays as a mcguffin--this is strictly a character driven film , with all the characters being either lively in a cartoonish way , undeveloped , or forgettable . the movie will spin-off in different directions , telling each groups' story , until it all comes together in the last reel and plays itself out . the film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it thinks is crazy into the comic mix , even a shaggy dog story . the language used has many expletives and is often hard to understand because of the heavy accents . the violence is brutal but cartoonish , as the film is styled much like a comic book . the rest of this heavily induced homage to musical video films , has a soundtrack that ranges from massive attack to oasis . ford's menacing psychotic performance , stood out as the film's most memorable one . pitt's self-effacing comedy was the performance i best enjoyed , as it gave the film a sparkling light touch ; while , dennis farina , also , was pleasingly comical and added some light touches to this cartoonish film . the only slow down in the film is in the opening moments , when the large cast of characters is introduced . other than that , the film moves at high speed , with all kinds of film gimmicks , from jump cuts to multi use of graphics . this is a film that thrives on controlled chaos as its signature theme . i would call it another dumb cult picture the director has made , one that suffers because there is no one in this film to care about . 
the film brings up a few interesting points about defending such an unappealing man and how legitimate is the insane plea , which if allowed to be used as a plea could really bog down the justice system with criminals trying to manipulate the system . the filmmaker probably didn't feel confident enough with kensington's testimony in favor of insanity and had winston put on a show for the court to prove he was really nuts . the film for all its soft spots , still had a good but enigmatic performance from mitchum , whose motives for taking on the army bigwigs and putting a dent in his career are never made quite clear . keenan wynn was an appealing loony . the film was interesting enough in spots to hold my attention , but it defeated its own purpose by making general kempton so politically immoral and wynn so nutty , that the film's liberal message can only be viewed as a muddled one . 
the opening battle scene is chaotic and bloody that begs for comparison with the realistic way " saving private ryan " opened its film . this old-fashioned type of hokey heroic war film , which since the vietnam war has been out of fashion , should be praised for its realistic gory opening battle scene and for its hollywoodish personal gun duel at the end , which was as thrilling as the one in " high noon . " the problem with this supposedly true story about a genuine russian hero , was that the long middle part was bogged down by an unmoving love triangle and a lot of empty political rhethoric that slowed down the action and took away from the suspense of the two snipers matching wits with each other . it also took away credibility from the overall truth of this real war story . but it is this love triangle that saps away from what the film was about , which even more than the war story itself , is about two men trying to see who is better at what they do . this could have just as easily have been the theme for a sports film , therefore the politics feels superfluous . the trouble with the film , is that it didn't work well for stretches that were too long , and the only performance i found interesting was ed harris's . jude law played his role like a matinee idol in the old days of hollywood war films would , which was to look good under all the war grime and be the good-hearted hero without a flaw . his performance did not hinder the film , but on the other hand , it didn't seem special to me . but the performance i found the most wanting , was joseph fiennes's , which i found belabored with muddled marxist speeches that made no sense . in fact , his role never added up , as i have no idea what he was supposed to symbolize . if he stops believing in the marxist cause because a girl rejects him as is indicated in the film , then he has to be a more shallow character than the director intended him to be . his performance woes could be blamed entirely on an inadequate script . 
it is a biopic that is brutally honest about the exiled writer as an opponent of castro's , one that lets us see that liberation to him was not only a matter of politics but of the freedom to be a homosexual and an artist , something which the castro regime couldn't agree with and came down harshly on both homosexuals and artists , by sending them to prison camps . his happiest moments in childhood seemed to be watching the nude men bathing and those moments connected with nature , such as his love for the landscape and the ocean . spanish actor javier bardem portrays arenas ( someone he closely resembles ) with great sexuality , perception and feeling , giving a virtuoso performance . castro will allow for no artistic freedom or homosexual activity , which he labels counterrevolutionary . julian schnabel has created an emotionally penetrating look at a man living with his alienation in a marginalized existence and using that bitter experience as a source of energy for his writing . this beautifully photographed film , which looks much like a series of paintings on canvas , might be too bleak for a general audience , but it paints a more realistic political view of castro's cuba than most of the recent films i have seen about this subject , and should be of special interests to those of all persuasions who care about freedom and the arts . 
it results in laughs that are engineered from the lowest common denominator of comedy . but the good news is , that there are laughs to be had , if you are willing to bite into the over-the-top performances , the unseamly sight gags , and absurd plot . the bad news is , the film is sympathetic to these revolting hustlers and the film's amoral theme is hard to justify , except to say that this is just a cartoon for adults . it also begins to drag , as the premise grows weary from overkill . " heartbreakers " is a forgettable fluff film , that tries unsuccessfully to work its way to romance and also be a caper flick . it works best when showing off the boobs of weaver and hewitt , who are outfitted in dresses sluts would wear to walk the streets , as the film proudly relies on the old adage , that sex sells . there were a number of funny bits , and they came from hackman's w . c . fields-like performance , calling out for the love of smoking and preaching its virtues , even encouraging children to take up smoking . what the comedy had going for it , was a lot of spunk , enough to overlook the film's many drawbacks . 
anthony mann is a master at directing these cheapie films and making them look stylish . he gets the most out of this thin story because of the complementary performances of raymond burr and steve brodie . violence and desperation are the themes of this noir film . if examined closely , there are many holes in the story , but what works very effectively is how the film shows that middle-class aspirations for the postwar period are tinged with cynicism . it's shown how there's a sense of brutality that fills the everyday american social scene . the paranoid couple feels the urgency to look out for themselves , not trusting anyone else to help them . this feeling of hopelessness the couple has , gives this film its classic noir look . 
the mystical theme of evil was never fully developed , but the film was well photographed and acted , and the story was very creepy . there were many odd touches that worked very well , that director freddie francis added to this original screenplay by jonathan rumbold & peter spenceley . there's also a surprise ending that fits in well with the film's theme of man's inhumanity . it makes for an above-average horror flick , one that horror fans in particular might enjoy more than others . 
a minimal story that is too thin for a feature film . it is about urban deterioration and alienation in taiwan as seen just seven days before 2000 and leading up to the 'new millennium . ' it makes one act like a bug , crawling on all fours and so on , as the victim first shows flu-like symptoms . at the 1998 cannes film festival , this taiwanese-french drama won a fipresci award , given by international critics . what i liked best about it were the half dozen musical numbers sung by grace chang , as the two tenants lip-synch and dance along to the tunes . the film would be interrupted by the fantasy scenes , where the dressed-up protagonists would go into their lively cabaret-like song and dance routine . some of the lively songs to counter the non-action scenes were : 'oh calypso , ' 'go away don't come back , ' 'i want you to-what i want is your love , ' 'gesundheit , ' and 'i don't care who you are . ' this film was initiated as part of the french tv series of one-hour end-of-millennium dramas . its appeal will probably be most appreciated by the music lovers of those old hong kong films ( grace chang was a popular singer in the china of the 1950s ) , and those admirers of french directors rivette and demy , whose musicals are also followed by strange stories and a dead-pan humor . it also should appeal to those who want to see the unusual , and their reward might be that this is a film that makes them think they have something to think about . for me , nothing much happened in this intriguing kafka-like idea for a film to rise above its leaky promises . it needed more of a story and protagonists with more personality , in order for it to feel more alive . 
a solid action thriller directed by alfred hitchcock . but it has many plot flaws and suffers from poor pacing and can best be perceived as a precursor to his much improved other 'framed innocent man pic , ' north by northwest . the film draws to an action conclusion , with barry and fry mixing it up on the statue . the film can be forgiven for its many patriotic speeches extolling the virtues of america , since there was a war taking place . but it can't be forgiven for how shoddy the story line was and how you can just about challenge every scene in this film as being fake . when the nazi ring gets cummings in nyc , there's no way they would handle him so casually , making his escape seem so easy , as they didn't even tie him up . when taken to nyc by baxter , a call would have been placed to kruger exposing cummings , which for some unexplained reason wasn't done . the other major flaw was that cummings and lane were much too bland to give this story personality . hitch's first choices of gary cooper and barbara stanwyck would have made the film that much more charismatic , though cummings and lane were not that bad as much as they were colorless . 
a funny spoof on hollywood , scripted by and starring steve martin . " we've got to get a crew , and i want the best damn crew we can afford ! " he has given kit three rules to live by : " there are no aliens , " " there is no giant foot trying to squash me , " and " i feel like i might ignite , but probably i won't . " he is further told , k . . . i . . . t stands for 'keep it together , ' which means keep mr . weenie in the pants . bowfinger assures her that this is the way kit likes to work , it's 'cinema nouveau . ' this movie about making a movie has the hollywood phony la-la scene down pat and under frank oz's sharp direction , the film gets all the laughs it can from its very funny satirical premise . martin and murphy were never funnier , and the supporting cast adds just the right ingredients to the comedy presentation . even though most of the film does work , some of the comedy routines became tiresome as the film progressed but not enough to spoil the lighthearted fun . 
a good joel mccrea flick . it is suspenseful , entertaining , fast-paced , and tautly scripted by eric ambler from a novel by geoffrey household . 
it was a hit at the 1998 afi filmfest . wade didn't see what happened and he doesn't know if he should believe jane , but he doesn't like her solution to the problem and the two of them show that they are cut from a different cloth . the film has the minimal amount of dialogue and holds our attention because the protagonist is a good guy , who ironically can only find freedom when he's in a real prison . the film's main flaw , is that it proves its point by wrapping things up with too nice of a pink bow tied around it . 
this bizarre supernatural art-horror film is the first feature with all dialogue recorded in esperanto ( an artificial international language created in the 1800s so everyone in the world could speak in the same tongue ) . there are english subtitles . it's a gorgeously photographed b/w film by cinematographer conrad hall ; a spooky tale about murderous sea creatures . it's filled with hokum , as it tells about the battle for souls between the god of light and the god of darkness . guess who wins ? this thin story has merit , as it casts a spellbinding effect over its eerie doings and strange surroundings . if its strangeness you are seeking , or a cultish horror film from the 1960s that is an oddity , or if you are a fan of horror films , then this is the film for you . others might not be so taken with the strange events taking place , events that seem more nutty than real ; and , they might not be taken by shatner's stiff performance . i found this b film engaging in an ingmar bergman way , but without the swedish director's ability to tell a better story . but , the film deserves an audience beyond its cultish fans . 
it's a gritty cop movie when the two protagonists are inarticulate and are trying to form a relationship to ease their inner pain . their romance is quirky and seems to be stumbling around to get someplace . unfortunately , when they do become articulate and mesh together , the film moves into the predictable formulaic mold and ends in a cornball way . her physical prowess in that incident would make make even the most macho policeman feel proud . even though catch seems like a freak show , sharon feels something about him that she doesn't from the other guys she goes out with . as for their hot moments together jlo is a natural for sex , but caviezel seemed too distant to really be getting into it . but the film can almost be forgiven for its sore points in storytelling , because these two star performers bring something to the screen that is curiously arresting . the problem with the film is that the filmmaker couldn't let their romance play out in a natural way . to make matters seem more artificial there is some loud , syrupy music before the film ends and the credits roll by , as jlo and caviezel drive off together seemingly having survived their personal tragedies with some big fake smiles on their faces . i wonder how many market research reports it took for them to come up with that happy ending ! 
the film's poetic title can be explained as follows : that the sun always sets instead of rises during the day of an execution . they are more interested to see how the chair works than in anything else . the jury didn't believe the 'ghost story' he told . but 46 says he can't be fooled , he would know his gestures anywhere . the story was well told , but the acting left a lot to be desired . and all that religious stuff thrown in , about how god listens to you , was strictly cornball . but as far as b-films go , this one is above average . 
strange bargain ( director : will price ; screenwriters : from a story j . h . a well-conceived mystery b-film , but strictly second feature material . 
the film takes us into territory film's rarely traverse . it crosses the emotional boundaries of a forbidden love . timing , which is a key to all romances blooming , is just right here . on the island , we see them kiss and are not made aware if anything more intimate took place . the film asks the question about what makes us love someone . mom's ideal is hardly less childish which is the point varda is making , the ideal mate sought is all about one's feelings and they are irrational . this is a suggestive film , touching a tabu subject , but it handles it delicately with an unflinching directness . this affair is viewed with the same frankness varda thinks we should view all things in life . the current aids epidemic must be faced with humor and real knowledge , or else ignorance about it will cause more damage than good . this film did not exploit an exploitive situation , and it provided much fuel for thought . 
the plot is pure film noir , but the film's production values are even cheaper than the usual noir film . it is shot in a dull , shadowless manner and the performers seem to be lifeless except for milburn stone , who shines in a rare starring role for him . but it comes too late for anderson , who committed suicide just a little earlier . the plot was too convoluted to give the film credibility . but the film's premise was still interesting enough . 
the energy and vitality of these musical scores and a host of bizarrely dressed supporting performers who fill the stage with song and dance , gives this film a comical circus flavoring , which manages to cover-up its clich ? -ridden story as much as possible . it's directed with an eye for color , especially the color of rouge , by the pop-musical enthusiast , the australian , baz luhrmann ( " romeo and juliet " / " strictly ballroom " ) , an mtv type of director , who is more interested at getting at what dazzles than the why of the dazzle . the film is a series of perpetual motion shots , never pausing to delve into any character study . the problem with that , is you don't really care what happens to the lovers . the spectacle of the film is the only substance offered , and its made sumptuously beautiful for the eye to feast on . what excuses this film from being such a rip-off of other films , is that what is stolen from other films works very well here . it gives the film all the breathless moments found in other films a chance to breath again in this whirlwind of a production that is in a constant climax mode . if all it took was energy and beautiful sets and costumes , then this production would be a glorious one ; but , what this film didn't have was a love story that could touch the heart , even as it screamed out that it was all about heart . this is an easy movie to praise for being inventive and diverting , but it cannot be admired for a film that has a semblance of truth about it . it's just another enjoyable but forgettable hollywood musical , in a long chorus line of such ventures . the film has the feel in all its excesses of a ken russell type of musical crossed with any number of hollywood ones , even such an illustrious traditional one as " singing in the rain . " the wealthy duke is the heavy in this film . he is played by richard roxburgh , who plays the one-dimensional role as tritely as it is written . the film's gimmick is having 20th century musical songs and routines , that are eye popping , fill this 19th century set musical . they range from songs such as : " the sound of music , " " your song , " " diamonds are a girl's best friend , " " material girl , " " smells like teen spirit , " " like a virgin , " " lady marmalade , " " silly love songs , " " all you need is love , " " up where we belong , " " don't leave me this way , " " heroes , " " in the name of love , " and " roxanne . " this is just a partial list of songs , as the stage is always tuned for some song and dance action . all the main characters played are the usual stock archetypes--nicole kidman was eye catching as the nightclub star and courtesan who is really a sweetie for a whore , but she was too physically big to be handled in a believable way by ewan mcgregor . i was amused by john leguizamo as the rascal-like toulouse-lautrec , and jim broadbent was overpowering in his role as ringmaster of this operation . he seems to be much too stagy a thespian for these more profane hollywood actors he's surrounded by , as he stood out from them because either he was a much better actor than they were or because he hammed it up too much . in any case , his performance did stick out like someone who is thumbing a ride back to topsy-turvy . yet i felt myself partial to his performance , as in every scene he was in i couldn't help being overwhelmed by his strong presence ; though , kidman's performance was the key one of the film . she handles her part in an admirable way , showing us a lot of leg and feeling for who she was ; but , the love story had no sparks and just didn't work right . it's a film that looked good ( lots of garish colors and stardust ) , sounded fine , and felt so-so . a great escape film in the tradition of hollywood spectacles , a film that does justice to the cancan dancers of the moulin rouge . it's a fun film to let one's hair down , to sit leisurely back with some popcorn and watch this film speed across the screen ; while , from time to time peeking in on the jewel-encrusted elephant that goes for satine's boudoir , or checking in on mcgregor's impoverished artist's digs as he slaves over the typewriter with an outside neon sign shining throughout the night ( speaking of clich ? s ) . 
director claude chabrol has come up with a diverting thriller , that is well-crafted and features a magnificent performance by philippe noiret as christian legagneur . what was missing in this better-than-average thriller , was a sense of passion . everything seemed to be happening in a too matter-of-fact manner . 
old-fashioned way , the ( director : william beaudine ; screenwriters : from a story by charles bogle [w . c . fields]/jack cunningham/garnett weston ; cinematographer : benjamin f . reynolds ; cast : w . c . a joyous w . c . it's a different version from the silent screen one that bombed , as here fields is allowed to ad lib and do his thing . fields is in fine comic form here , even doing a ridiculous juggling act with a cigar-box . 
he replaced the deceased warner oland , and plays chan in a more avuncular style . this film comes at the onset of ww 11 and therefore has a patriotic theme , which is well-crafted into the sabotage story so as not to seem misplaced storytelling . " one enemy is one too many . " the best part of this enjoyable whodunit , was that it was hard to guess who ryner was . 
he was replaced in the film by wheeler oakman , who doesn't have much of a part . the story was a conventional hero against villain one , but the film had a certain splendor about it that elevated its melodramatics . 
mildred pierce is a noir melodrama that served as a comeback film for waning star joan crawford , who was recently dumped by mgm . the film was nominated for 6 oscars , and joan won the best actress award . she certainly had a reason to . but this kid is so rotten and has such a vile mouth , that it's impossible to believe that her mother could still like her so much . the acting and cinematography and curtiz's directing were fine . the story didn't make too much sense , but it was lively . blyth is over-the-top bitchy in her femme fatale role . but the noir film also is intent on making the point , how difficult it is for a woman on her own to make it in a patriarchal society . 
a thoughtless formula movie about street racers , that moves so fast from one scene to the next it could be geared for those who suffer from add ( attention defecit disorder ) ; it should give you a few jolts and cinematic thrills , but the price paid is that logic is the first thing thrown out of the car window . the theme of this summertime movie could be that there's little difference in morality between criminals and undercover cops , and that's probably giving the film too much credit for thinking about anything but the box office . it's all about racing cars that seem like rockets when equipped with nitrous oxide ; it's the driving scenes that keep you from nodding off and since they use real cars , with real stunt riders , that's what grabs your attention throughout and makes you a captive of this meaningless but childishly fun tale . the film's best attempt at dialogue goes something like this . . . first place racer ( diesel ) : " it don't matter if you win by an inch or by a mile ; winning's winning . " but if you don't mind being taken for a mindless adrenaline ride across the glittering blacktops of los angeles , this could be excused as a guilty pleasure treat . this was exciting but meaningless stuff ; there was no artistic accomplishment derived from this by-the-numbers action pic . the acting can't be faulted , but it was left on the skidmarks on the road , as this script was too inane to provide any realistic characterizations . the two women had badly underwritten parts , walker was forgettable in his role , and diesel was all high-octane energy , acting either angry or looking tough with his shaved head while constantly flexing his musles . he gave this film whatever acting charisma it had to have , so at least one human could look as good as the cars . this was the kind of film where you could have walked in for the last 15 minutes and would have had no trouble following the story . it's one of those bad flicks that is irresistible because there's a charge to it that rides through its mundane story and allows it to almost get away with its ludcricous dialogue . the dialogue that made me crack my biggest smile went like this -- dom to brian : " i live my life a quarter-mile at a time , for those 10 seconds , i'm free . " if you are looking for a film about reality or one that has a philosophy , or one that just makes sense , i would avoid this one . but if you want to see a film about people whom you probably wouldn't like if you met them on the road in real-life , but on film you can be tolerant of them and even might find this film oddly enjoyable , then this popcorn movie might taste buttery to you . it has those other recent car movies , driven , gone in sixty seconds , and grand theft auto , beat by a city mile . 
an atmospheric and most entertaining charlie chan episode . it was the longest charlie chan made at 79 minutes and it was the first one not based on an earl derr biggers book . this film was more a case of charlie chan in the english countryside than in london , but why quibble over a title when the story was so entertaining ! 
nobody does an adultery film quite the way the french do it . this melodrama is no exception . the co-director g ? rard depardieu is also one of the film's stars , and does a credible job in both roles . there's nothing much to do in town , so mina is a frequent movie-goer . films give her a chance to escape reality , as she excitedly tells tommy : " good movies make me feel good . " he feels it's a slap in his face . the film builds to its climax as mina's passion , onced opened up , can't be stopped . it is intelligently handled , but somehow i did not find the film compelling . perhaps it was because georges was painted as a dull man whose strength was in his hands and in his decency , but who had no interest in fantasy . in the last scene at the gas station , a bad imitation of the scene jacques demy brilliantly did in the umbrellas of cherbourg , georges and mina meet while filling up and are going off in different directions . the scene had no real feeling to it , as it felt forced . it seemed to crudely hammer out its point that adultery is a way of escaping a boring marriage , and it seemed more interested in wrapping up the film than in engaging the story with more life . the film looks at this adultery from the view of the woman , which makes it different from the way most films are done . it takes no stand on the adultery , but what it does very well is catch the subtleties and complications that occur in a very believable way . there is a lot of hurt to go around , which makes it a bittersweet love story . the film is set in the normandy region of the 1960s ; it might not seem as relevant today , as its old-fashioned story and french new wave flavor of the 1960s loses a lot of the psychological impact for today's viewers . what it savors , is the subtle performances of bouquet , depardieu , and berling . though , without the middle-aged carole bouquet's touching characterization , this would have been an impossible bridge to cross . 
the acting was good , the suspects did a fine job of not letting on who was the guilty one , there was a good comedy routine between the wise guy sheriff and the wise man oriental sleuth , and the story was well-crafted . this was an above-average one in the series . 
it starts off with some whistling and a monologue by the unseen whistler , just as it was done on radio : " i am the whistler . . . and i know many things , for i walk by night . " what it will be . the whistler states at the end : " i know because i am the whistler . " the result is an entertaining b film . 
the film becomes a strong love story , rather than an attempt to do a bio on joyce . trieste plays a more important part in this film than does dublin , probably because modern dublin is entirely different from the one joyce knew . that this film is the anti-tourist look at him , one that shows his darker nature and of how jealous and maddening he could be about sex , is a credit to the direction it was aimed at . nevertheless , the film is still a conventional one . the storytelling was of the old-fashioned kind , which in this case works as a detriment to the film . too many situations of the artist complaining the way they do in formula films of this genre exists , such as when joyce complains : 'no one understands me . ' because of its pedestrian approach to the artist , trying to get to him through seeing how nora viewed him , it failed to peel away the many layers of this very complicated genius ; and , it failed to make the story a compelling one . at times it felt like a soap opera rather than drama . what i learned from the film , that wasn't common knowledge before , was more about nora than i did about joyce . this is basically her film and her story . the main actors were engaging . susan lynch is a bold and daring nora , with a quick uncouth wit and a sometimes long face which changes when she smiles and shows how earthy she can be . the problem with all the stylized intelligence the film brought , which is a fine achievement , is that it always appears strained and never carefree . it looks like an art-house film that can't get out of the strait-jacket it placed itself in . 
there will be lots of titty shots and shots from her waist down . but he's much smoother than the bimbo girls and shows them his phony id card while smooth talking them . the problem with this slickly done film , is that everything is only surface deep . we never read the terrorist's mind or get to know much about him or why he does what he does . this is strictly an in-your-face film experience , as the director uribe keeps it at a sensual level and never probes for a possibly deeper story . what this does , is make it a film that was diverting because of the nuanced performances by g ? mez and gabriel . a forgettable film but , nevertheless , an enjoyable one to see . 
the poverty row studio monogram pictures picked the series up for the remaining episodes and the quality diminished . the film has many plot twists and the usual chan setup for the mystery story to unfold . but the story is far-fetched and tries too hard to be mysterious , which causes it to falter in credibility . but the desert atmosphere of the 16th-century castle , the usual comic antics of number two son , and all the suspects moving cautiously around the dark corners of the castle , should please charlie chan fans and give them their usual thrills . 
an above-average entry into the charlie chan series . this version is a remake of the 1931 fox release " charlie chan carries on , " a film that no longer exists . he says , " it's a bitter challenge to me . " what made this chan adventure fun was that the many characters in it were easy to know , and it was a difficult case to solve . 
japanese auteur , beat takeshi kitano ( sonatine/hana-bi ) , one of the more provocative living directors , continues to make unusual films that are difficult to categorize . this one veers away from his usual violent ones and is a more conventional bittersweet road comedy film , but it is also a very strange film , with many odd slapstick touches to it and many experimental shots of weird images and uncalled for dream sequences . he plays the lead character kikujiro , a seedy , low-level ex-yakuza who is gruff , sentimental , bumbling , and profane . the movie seems to be about outsiders confronting the middle-class . it divides its sections like a child's photo album , as each episode is about how he spent his summer . it has titles like : " the octopus man . " there's also no more school activities like soccer practice . there is a madcap comedy scene of mister not knowing how to swim and nearly drowning . the film feels very sentimental , but scenes change moods with the drop of hat and it's not that easy to predict what comes next even though it looks in many ways like one of those familiar road pics about a mismatched innocent kid and an adult who's rough on the exterior but really cares inside . in the end i don't know exactly what this deliberately paced film , which seems too long at two hours , is trying to say or what it accomplishes ( which is not a negative comment , but rather reflects that the director succeeded in making his own kind of film ) . the only thing that made sense to me in a positive way , was that they were both outsiders and the filmmaker is saying it will be tough for someone to make it in japanese society unless they are disciplined and pursue from an early age what they want . the kid at this early age will have to reconcile that granny will raise him , and that her advice is to study hard in school never sounded more conventional but nevertheless seemed to be sound advice . what the kid learned from mister , is that there's a wrong way and right way to do things . the kid had one of those unforgettable summer vacations that put a little fun into his sad life . i wasn't won over by this film , it doesn't seem like the type of film kitano should be making , but it has a strange quality about it that somehow appeals to me because there's an edginess to it around its carefully manicured sentimentality . it also seemed to have its heart in the right place , as kitano has said his own father was an inspiration for the way he played the title character . there was a grimness to this film that its physical humor couldn't hide . 
but if the plot was silly , the fun in this charlie chan story was in watching number one son ( keye luke ) run around like a chicken without a head , seeing charlie overcome being shot in the leg and being kidnapped , and how the film captured the racetrack atmosphere . it makes for a satifactory but not an always well-developed mystery film . 
this charlie chan episode lacked humor , as there was no number one son present . but despite being a bit dry , it applied the usual formula methods and proved to be entertaining . 
a gritty , realistic look at life in the black ghetto . the film is flawed by the obviousness of the situation it shows , yet despite these flaws there is a power in seeing how real these people are . there was no new ground broken , but it did hit a nerve as to what life in a housing project looks like . the film has a powerful opening , which sets the stage for its tragic tale . the film works because it had an honest energy to it , though when it tries to say something meaningful it feels like so much jive . the triteness and predictability of the story prevents the film from traveling too far from the reality of the housing projects the filmmaker knows . the film can't penetrate any further than some surface responses . it's a cautionary inner-city film that should well serve the youthful urban audience that will be most attracted to its story and should relate to them better than it would to a wide audience . 
a classy western filmed on a low-budget . this is a very pleasant western drama about those who are very good opposing those who are rotten . it's a film with good family values , and it's done in a very satisfying way . it makes the most out of its human interest story , as the script by dan ullman slowly builds up to its climactic action scene . joel mccrea gives an outstanding performance as a moral person , who must do what is right even if it means placing himself in danger . 
an entertaining mystery filmed from the back lot of mgm , though it convincingly looks like foggy london . the only thing that is found inside is a note in red chalk saying : pay or be seen no more ! it was strictly lightweight fare , done in a breezy style , but it proved to be an enjoyable b-film . 
it doesn't make too much political sense and it glorifies the nazi police force of berlin in a revolting manner , but it's a snappy film and quite entertaining . the disclosing of the one masterminding this scheme adds the final surprise to this film that is full of plot twists . 
it's set on the lower east side of manhattan , with its abandoned buildings and shabby tenements , which gives it the look of a war-torn city . she's as loopy as one can be . jarmusch is one of america's most talented independent directors , who continues to make original films . this is his humble beginning in films , and the result is a well-crafted technical accomplishment with flashes showing of his great ability to tell a story . permanent vacation is not for the casual filmgoer , but for one who can appreciate an independent way of looking at film . 
edward dmytryk was a victim of the hollywood blacklist , here he returns after a few years in exile to make a stanley kramer produced message drama shot in a realistic style . the film makes good use of the san francisco streets to tell its serial-killer psycho story . the film's message was not that well received , but the suspense of tracking down the nondescript psycho had a good touch to it . the film was a blend of film noir and social drama , pointing out the urban problems of alienation and the public's indifference to those who are mentally unbalanced . 
sternberg had a different vision for the film and after the opening chaotic scenes were told like a straight crime story , the director changed the reality of the silent film and abandoned hecht's version . sternberg gave this film a blend of realism , german expressionism and hollywood sentimentality . this works out fine , as bull is even more successful than before and becomes the uncrowned king of the chicago underworld . bull was portrayed as a burly , physical man with complex emotions . he always wanted to elevate feathers in stature and enjoyed doing it in a crass way , as he gave her jewelry as presents . that he could be generous as well as ruthless and had a laugh that could fill a room with his giant personality , made him a villain who was not one-dimensional . during its time this was an edgy film , but the times have changed and its story doesn't hold up as well today . it's a film that is mostly interesting for its historical contribution to cinema , as it set the conventions for this genre . it is also a visually challenging film , as sternberg filled the screen with symbols and imagery it had never seen before . this changed the way gangster films were made , and the visuals of this film are still considered to be innovative and stylish . some critics have classified this as an example of film noir mainly because of all the alienation and corruption shown . it's not like the film noir of the 1940s , but more like a noir predecessor . interestingly enough , at the first academy awards ceremony in 1929 , the film received its only award , for story writer ben hecht . 
warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . the film ends with a long kiss between the japanese-american detective and the white artist , making a loud statement that it's fine that the heroine prefers someone of a different race . it's a satisfactory fuller work , that is lurid while also reflective of the racial divide in the country . in his gritty way , fuller hammers home the point of the need for racial tolerance and that there's urban alienation out there to deal with . the problem with the film , is that the mystery story was never developed and seems included as just an afterthought . 
director joseph l . mankiewicz switched greene's anti-american premise around and made it an anti-communism theme , which was to the detriment of the film as it seemed to lose its potent messages . mankiewicz turns it into a feeble murder mystery and an uninvolving romantic love triangle , which is told in flashback . the film was shot in magnificent shades of black and white , and it was filmed on location in vietnam giving it a look of authencity . 
warning : spoilers throughout review . the star of this film is pal's special effects , orchestrated by gordon jennings , which won an oscar . the acting was wooden , the romance was blah , and the religious messages tacked on were pathetic . but this sci-fi spectacle had much in it to be praised for ; it was especially scary , the martian design was sleek and ominous ( there were spider-like characters with cobra-like heads ) , and the recreation of an atomic bomb blast was spectacular . it wisely stuck to the theme of mankind's arrogant belief of his own superiority rather than go the red menace route as most sci-fi films of that day did . in the lab the scientists study samples of their blood collected and the martian electronic eye forrester salvaged , which the martians use as a periscope , leads the scientists to the conclusion that the martians are physically primitive even if they are mentally superior to us . they also have anemic blood and because of the darkness of mars , it's 140 million miles away from the sun , they can't handle a strong light . 
the crime caper was too absurd and trite to carry the film , but the fast-pace and the finale featuring an exciting car chase through the deserted streets of lower manhattan gave the film some oomph . but backett pretends he doesn't know what he's saying , as he stalls to check out the story . it was a taut suspense film , catching the despair of the protagonist who because of his human failings had a momentary lapse in good judgment and went through a hellish experience to atone for his misdeed . but they just couldn't get any romance going in this film to make the story seem more palpable , as it works mainly for its action sequences . 
in his short career , mark wahlberg has been most effective when playing characters full of na ? ve sincerity . in boogie nights , the yards , and even three kings , his talent is in making the audience believe he's a good guy with a lot of heart , just trying his best . the problem with the film lies in director stephen herek's inability to take advantage of the strengths that wahlberg displays . herek ( bill and ted's excellent adventure , mr . holland's opus ) , directing a screenplay from crazy/beautiful director john stockwell , does rely on wahlberg's sincerity at first -- we easily sympathize with chris' work ethic and passion -- but doesn't allow it to carry the movie later , when the film could really use it . from that point on , rock star unfortunately takes itself a little too seriously , taking time to document stuff we've already read about ( it is a full 15 years later , after all , and hair bands like motley crue have been telling these stories for a while ) . rock star would've been better off as a bigger satire of the time , ripping into the music , the people , and the period , and allowing wahlberg's wide-eyed , once-in-a-lifetime experiences to anchor the movie's emotional honesty and sympathy . aniston could have certainly contributed to that ; i can't imagine too many people staring into those expressive eyes on the big screen and not empathizing with the woman . that would go a long way in getting us deeper into the characters , but it doesn't happen . herek does direct the concert scenes with a certain urgency and is able to capture that arena rock experience , as cool or ridiculous as you might think it is . but as chris finds his way in the final act , the movie breaks down a bit , more interested in having us feel good than actually being sincere to the story . they should've asked mark wahlberg about sincerity -- he knows how it should work . rating : * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| 
there isn't much of a plot , and what there is isn't that important . it is simply a frame within which to explore the culture of some vibrant spanish gypsies . in fact , the actual " talkie " scenes almost become too much of a distraction from the rich portrayal of the community . in between are moments with those in charge of the caravacas family , building a slow , poignant path to revenge . luckily the plot development is repetitively simple so that all of the characters have room to be sympathetic . there isn't an annoying " good and evil " perspective placed on the viewer . this film is not about picking sides in an argument or making morality calls . but the music and dancing are the key roles in vengo . between the variety shown and the pride taken in skill and passing down of tradition , it's easy to become mesmerized with the culture . a nice added touch is that men take as much pride as women in being able to evoke physical grace . and though the dancing does have a sexually alluring quality , it is not the reason for participation . it can be difficult to grasp the lyrics because they are only partially subtitled . this is unfortunate for outsiders who know little about gypsy life because it's impossible to guess at the inspiration for such emoting performances . at least the emotional expression of the singers provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding about how attached the music is to tradition . gatlif has managed to utilize an old , almost boring , plot structure to respectfully portray a culture much overlooked . he obviously loved his subject and the way in which it was filmed provides a contagious appreciation for a people often misunderstood . rating : * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : nr 
an enjoyable monogram made charlie chan mystery , with much trickery disguising who the real culprit is and a very clever premise but one that is not always well executed . this is accomplished through working the corpses like a puppeteer does the puppets , therefore it appears as if the dead person is walking . there was a flurry of one-liners , confusius-like sayings , and some stereotype racial fright humor by moreland exhibited . it all made for an entertaining but not totally satisfying film . 
there's supposed to be no one aboard the ship , but all the passengers say they received a call from daniels to come aboard ; though , daniels denies ever making such a call . the boat remains at the dock , as charlie keeps everyone on the ship . he's a movie actor , travelling incognito . but , as is usually the case in this series , the least likely one is the guilty party . but the story itself made little sense . what was outstanding , was the atmospheric harbor scenes . this gave the film an eerie feeling and made the fishy story seem less briny . 
a pleasant film that is not all that good as far as the crime caper story goes , but still has something about it that is endearing . it's in the tradition of hollywood films as escape vehicles , as it evokes a nostalgia for those kind of b-films that the studios used to routinely put out and were not that worried about the gaffes in the production . if you're a fan of the 1940s film noir , especially the classy billy wilder " double indemnity , " then you should find much in this latest woody allen comedy/mystery film to remind you of that film and others like it . woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy the upholstered apartment furnishings , the lingo of the times , and the clothing worn and hairstyles . it was like watching one of those b-films , but instead of being in b & w this one is a lazy color version of it . it's the kind of faded out coloring that would have been used to make a 1940 film noir , if they were made in color . the retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed by santo loquasto and shot by zhao fei in mostly plum and gold colors that burnished on the screen . that's a home he made burglar-proof . admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the usual woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character , and to make matters worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners with silly double-entendre sexual meanings . it's a role that he's ritualized and could do it sleepwalking by now . but it worked for me because i didn't care about all that and instead got caught up with the film's casual look and the way it caught the look of the period's film noir , and i found the clash he had with helen hunt brought out the sides of his personality that he's battling within himself all his artistic life . woody seems more relaxed in this role than he has been in his more recent films . and , since the film has no artistic pretensions--it's more a homage to the b-films of the forties , it seemed easier to handle than some of his more recent ritualized woody-by-the-numbers flicks or those pale imitations of those european auteurs he so much admired like bergman--films he slavishly imitated that never worked for him . mind you , this is not a good film but one that can be viewed as an escape from reality . something that is not all that bad during these troubling economic days of that compassionate conservative administration of president bush . seeing this film made me forget for the moment about bush's war on stem cell research and the way he goes out of his way to please his extreme right-wing supporters and those big corporations that also supported him . the same purpose could be said of those early films in the forties , with the world being invaded by nazis . escape films were very much in vogue and served a purpose . i don't usually care for escape films , but every so often they feel right and can be enjoyable if you can really escape reality by watching them . those are the kinds of films i let my critical guard down on , and that's the case with this woody allen flick . 
richard wallace directs a film noir that is more a character study than it is a puzzler . it was an entertaining b-film that ably caught an honest but desperate man somehow hooking up with a falsehearted woman in a dangerous relationship , as the actors good performances overcame the cheap production values and slight story . 
a film noir that is more a character study of a small-time jewel thief than one concerned with its pulp story . the artistic shots are like those that orson welles did in " the lady from shanghai . " the film succeeds as a visual feast in noir photography , which includes shadowy framed scenes and close-ups of the characters sweating during the heist . the film's weaknesses lie in the slight story and how it came at the end of the film noir cycle , so all the artistry of the noir devices seemed to be beaten to the ground by now . 
this film has a different look to it , as its color tones are strikingly in browns and soft yellows . they added a touch of black humor . ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the outside influences facing the alienated julia . i wasn't enlightened by these unnecessary scenes , in fact i thought they were pretentious . almost the entire film is a boring rant by julia , where a fine actress like arcelia ramirez just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side . her classical story didn't play like great drama , but felt more like soap opera or a tragic headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing her children for no logical reason . all the drama evaporated from this presentation , as the film's reward seemed to be a visual feast of looking at the interior of an apartment situated in an ugly apartment building's courtyard . yet this film shouldn't be totally ignored , as the auteur director took chances with this story and was technically innovative as he gave the film a different look to it . that alone should earn him applause for the effort made . at least , his film wasn't stale as most commercial ventures are today . the overriding fault for this art-house film was that it is not poetic in a story that must be poetic to be felt as drama and not soap opera . it unfortunately comes off as too distant ( it's lost in the mundane world for the answers to julia's problems ) for the viewer to empathize with julia's internal misery . it also suffers from comparison to other medea presentations--so many great versions of it were put on as plays , plus the film versions by pasolini and von trier were far superior . 
one of those innovative shoestring budget sci-fier films that edgar g . ulmer made a career out of . this one is overall a competent work with some uniquely atmospheric scenes . it used the same set designs as ingrid bergman did in the 1948 " joan of arc . " the alien invaders didn't put up much of a fight , but i bet if ulmer had a few more days of shooting time we would have seen a lot more action . 
considering the budget constraints the film was operating under , this film nevertheless proves to be an entertaining one and features a well-crafted script by jerome bixby ; it is one that is devoid for the most part ( except for the character played by kim spalding ) of stock characterizations . it sets an eerie atmosphere by its shadowy photography and in the claustrophobic setting of the spaceship , and even if the monster in a rubber-suit was not as scary as laughable--that only proves how much fun the film could be . i happened to like it better than i did alien , even though the later is technically far superior . 
he has taught film at columbia university and nyu , and has said that he made this film because he can't remember as a youth watching films that were made in chile . the film was written spontaneously while at the workshop to fit the emotions of the teenage actors recruited . it's a familiar theme about teenage alienation , as the story suffers at times from being strained . also , there are raw emotional scenes that are difficult to watch when they are extended for too long . but what prevents this one from just being a clich ? teenager film , is that they are presented as genuine teens even if they are not that appealing and the story might not be compelling to everyone--especially those who watch such loud kids in public places and are turned off by them ( i guess that would include me in that category ) . the film is political in nature and it should be best understood by the teens now living in chile who are familiar with the social climate in their home turf . the teens grapple with their frustrations and loneliness , and mature somewhat by the film's end . this seemed to be what the audience was rooting for to happen , as they were obnoxious but not bad sorts . 
a gothic mom-in-distress thriller for those who might believe in ghosts or at least are open-minded , or for those who like a scary puzzler story to be grounded in those old-fashioned techniques of getting at the human emotions rather than being a computerized technical special-effects production of the supernatural . the 29-year-old acclaimed chilean-born , spanish-based director , alejandro amen ? bar ( open your eyes/thesis ) , provides a surprise ending to this chiller , which the clever viewer might guess since there are enough clues laid down . that's something " the sixth sense " did , but there it worked better because the story was more plausible and less artsy , so when the surprise ending resulted it seemed more satisfactory than in amen ? bar's film . the dark and somber tone of amen ? bar's film lingers for too long to make it seem anything more than an atmospheric and stylish mumbo jumbo scare film . it creeps along at a gruelingly slow pace , belaboring its point that ghosts can live among the living . but time seems irrelevant here , as it could be set at any time , though the story fits most readily into the victorian period . the house is not only creepy and filled with ghost sounds , but is enveloped in darkness because all the windows must be covered with thick curtains as the children are mysteriously allergic to the light and if exposed it could be fatal to them . there are 50 doors , 15 keys , and enough dark corners and creaky floorboards to even scare a dead person . when those clich ? d scary formula effects don't work enough scares , the background music goes into a high crescendo to add more chills . it's a scary movie because it takes on a number of different themes ; such as , madness , ghosts haunting a house , religious dogma , sexual repressions , and hysteria . the film was heading in the right direction until the surprise ending left me less pleased with it . the striking performance by ms . kidman , who carries this pic , and the feeling of loneliness it had established , make it a film that has much to recommend it despite its shortcomings . 
a chic modern vampire tale that is visually pleasing in its presentation but its scattered storyline seemed anemic , as it wavers between a love and horror story . it also offers a facile philosophy tract on good and evil ( the chinese director studied philosophy in england ) , as the director takes a stab at making this film into a religious fable about finding the truth . that i take to be the film's heavy statement , as it comes between the vampire's long stares , heavy breathing sounds , and gushy looks at his women vics before he sates himself on their blood . it was a strange and stylishly modern vampire tale that is set in london , that tried to be ever so cute and succeeded mostly in being enigmatic and weirdly captivating as both a thriller and a romance story . the relationship between the cop and the suspect was grounded in reality and had the only dialogue in the film that wasn't risible . their perfect love is interrupted by some ridiculous dialogue between them , especially the one about the theory of three-brains . the film isn't good when it comes to following the script , it seems pleasing only because of the visually chilling atmosphere it presents . this is the kind of delicate horror film with artsy pretensions that has law tell the pale looking l ? wensohn , that he needs the love that is in her blood . there were too many lines like that for me to be pleased with the film overall , as it seemed to me that it wished it could be more campy and funny yet it foolishly took itself to be a serious drama . there was something comical in its blood that it couldn't quite get out of its bloodstream . he lacks a specific component in his blood without which he will die . a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good script , and that's what does this hazy puzzler in : the beautiful looking film just doesn't make sense and can't be explained away by such weak attempts at philosophizing . 
a syrupy serving of freudian analysis that looks tempting but tastes of too much superego , id , and subconsious jive to be taken seriously . it's hollywood's version about what psychoanalysis is all about , which is making the analyst a combination of a savior and parental figure who can magically unlock the secrets of the mentally ill by offering them love and concern on a couch . this is the first major film about that subject , and its sincere presentation to show it in its best light is often awkward and seems quite outdated when viewed today . hitchcock throws in a murder mystery that works a little better than all the mumbo jumbo psych 1 lingo the viewer must sit through . it's a very heavy-handed film that is earnestly played by the stars , but has no resonance . it was one of the master's weaker films , yet it's still worth seeing because there are many imaginative hitchcock touches throughout . the script was written by ben hecht , who obviously didn't have much of a feel for the subject-matter . ingrid and peck do their best to work through the stale lines they are forced to say , though they never make their characters believable despite their best thespian efforts . this film is really spellbound . 
it is shot in a semi-documentary style and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film critics have classified it under . the story of duke malloy catches ferguson's interest . to make the film more snappy the producers called in raoul walsh , though not credited , to shoot some scenes over . but the filmlooks dated . 
it has an exciting plot and is properly atmospheric despite its cheap studio sets . but , it seemed anti-climactic when compared to the tight story that preceeded it . the film had the mood of film noir , as milland is the innocent one who has no luck convincing society that he is indeed innocent . there is a sinister tone to the film that plays well . it's a scene that perfectly captures the chilling mood this thriller evoked . 
one film critic , tom milne , aptly said that cornel wilde maintains his reputation in this film for making the most likable bad movies around . sharks' treasure is an action-packed nonsense thriller that is very entertaining . in this oddity film , wilde is the producer , writer , director , and star . he could have used someone else to give him some help with the plot and he could have worked more with the supporting cast to make their roles more plausible and meaty . everyone seemed like a cartoon character , as there was no attempt made at character development or for the storyline to make too much sense . the film feels like it's stuck in a strange space-warp , as the all-male treasure hunters are out at sea and are pretty close to going insane . these hombres are bad dudes , bad actors , and bad punsters . this all seems bizarre and hardly real , but it's full of emotion and the action is a hoot to behold . it's a film that has to be seen to be treasured for what it brings up from such a slight story . 
" joy ride " is calculated to draw fear from the viewer and does not attempt to develop character or enlarge its story , as it goes on a wild cross-country ride into dark terrain . its menacing trucker theme reminded me most of steven spielberg's 1971 film " duel , " though this one is played more for laughs . it's also aided by many noirish images and small touches among the supporting characters that give the film a quirky humor , as it scales familiar genre territory from remote gas stations to dead-end dusty roads to hostile redneck bars . but here the material is freshened with a different take on it . but we never see him through the hazy windshield of his rig , which makes him even more scary . how he does--just doesn't seem to matter , as the film plays out its hand as a sophomoric joke gone dangerously bad . anyway , while the story is moving at a frenetic pace , serious thought is not called for . there's b-film fun here if you don't mind the many holes in the story and how slight the plot is and how the sadistic trucker can set so many successful traps for them when it doesn't seem possible , and that we are never let in on the secret of how he does it . fuller nervously says , " much more than usual . " but there's always an element of fun in how absurd this all is , and the mostly teen-ager audience where i saw this film laughed at parts of it and shrieked in fright during the parts that were creepy . it's not a terribly interesting film but the director john dahl ( " red rock west " / " the last seduction " ) and his writers clay tarver and j . j . abrams , have made a film that knows its audience and knows how to pull its punches . it's an easy film to critique for what it doesn't do , but what it does do very well is take you for a comically dark fantasy ride and the filmmaker keeps this thriller tense throughout . the result is a cleverly done cultish film that's scary , building to that grotesquely violent finale in the motel . it's also a bit kinky without any explicit sex scenes . a film that should be admired totally for its entertainment value and filmmaking craftsmanship , and the engaging performance by zahn . 
his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic , straight forward ambitious project of sayles . the strength that comes from such a story , is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented . the problem with all this , is that since no specific country was named , it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem , and that makes the problem gigantic , with no one to be specifically blamed , especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages , it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings . the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated , that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone , that governments have to be held accountable for their actions , and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing , even if , most of all , people have to learn how to help themselves . this is a very strong , independent minded picture , that chooses to tell a very difficult story , one that not many people will take comfort in . but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world . it seems that this film might have some influence , but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do , as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
the cast is superb . it is rare that a film has such a meaty part for one woman to play . . . this film has two such parts . the girls never seemed taken with a genuine love of music except as it suited their talents . the well-crafted screenplay by frank cottrell boyce , is ably directed by tucker , who is directing his first feature film . the only fault i found with his direction , is that i thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what hilary and jackie experienced , that is , we didn't have to see it from each one's point of view . i thought the film would have been better served if the action was continuous , the going back over the same scenes from a different point of view really killed the pace of the film , slowing it down too much . this is a film that glows with confidence , sparked by a maturity of material , that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact one's entire life . the film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars , they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and , also , it was deftly handled by the director's ability to keep the movie light , not to make jackie's situation into a downer . . . and the music helped , it was simply marvelous . 
and somehow rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise , that is similar in some aspects to the orpheus and eurydice myth , whereas orpheus rescued his love from hades , but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear , he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that eurydice would think that he didn't care for her anymore . so she lets her live with her , even though she would rather not have her there . this film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera , classical painting , and victorian soap opera like-dramatics , to get across its strange wit and rilkean-like observations of what can be seen from life when you become a passive observer of it . it could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters' personality foibles , as they mock or imitate what the real-life troubled modern heterosexuals in nyc are up to , as paul acts out the part at being the tall dark , silent type of macho he-man , who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters : estelle , with her pretentious romantic soul , who is endowed with beautiful breasts ; and her more down to earth sister , who is not the romantic type , but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life , who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence . everyone is meant to be a cartoon character , ones' whom you can poke fun at , especially when they take themselves seriously . estelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy , wrongfully hurt in a relationship , or too consumed in their fantasy world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship . the film's aim is to be humorous about this . in any case , this is a very unusual and original work , that is sometimes slow-going , missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good ; but , more often than not , it is right on the mark , using its token males , paul , as an insignificant stud , a servicer of the female race , and jack , as an untrustworthy spouse , perceived as being capable of violent acts , as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man , in a most peculiar way . this film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships . . . . . incidently , the funniest line in the movie is reserved for paul , who tells estelle , " i wouldn't even tell you a lie , much less the truth . " i think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about . 
keitel , if you stretch your gullability a bit , is a great american film director , returning to his native greece after 35- years in the states . what fascinates him , is that they saw the century come in with its hopes and aspirations , they were not politically motivated , but were interested in recording what went on with the people and the times they lived in , what was right and wrong about those times , regardless of the mess that resulted from the mistakes the politicians made . this is an ostentacious and mesmerizing film , about a film director's obsession with the importance film plays in recording history . it is also a film that is bleak and despairing , as it goes on its long and weary journey over hostile territories , where governments could never be anything but inhumane and where revolutions were betrayed and costly . this allows us to see what the director saw as a child . again , it is a homage to how important it is to record history so that it cannot be forgotten . this allows for the film to wax poetic , to become a meditation on the landscape , to indulge our sense of the incomprehensible , as we see what the film-maker is seeing ; we all become foreigners in this eeriness , in this lost century , where the truth has been maimed . its images are always powerful , even if the dialogue seems superfluous and banal . it is starkly photographed in the fog and in the rubble torn buildings where the people barely exist , as they remain there , hoping for miracles to get them by . the fog is the only place normalcy is allowed to be , and even here , the dangers are always in the background . that is the message delivered , from this politically motivated and visually aesthetic film , full of emotion and bereavement for what could have been , but is now ruined by blind hatred . the film is tiresome , at times , too cliche ridden for the potent message it delivers for it be as great as its cinematography is . 
dark city is a sci - fi/noir thriller , that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity . everything attempted here has been done before , but that still doesn't take away from the film's feeling of looking like it is an original . credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city . and since he is not sure if he did it or not , he has a dazed look on his puss , like he will have throughout the entire film . hurt is the deadpan , hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir film , leading the investigation . he will be on the run for the remainder of the film , innocent though he may be , just like a protagonist in earlier noir films , questioning authority and trying to pull himself together , unsure of whom to trust . his visit to the automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in nyc , but this automat was cheerless and cold , only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city . he falls in love with her anyway , and the message of the film becomes only too clear , it is in the heart that the individual is born , and the heart can't be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination . proyas has created a visually challenging movie , that is backed - up by some thoughtful ideas . it is the kind of film that ufo'ers and alien watchers will tell ya' , see , i told you there was life out there in space . but to others , this is still only pedestrian stuff , it is not the real deal . and the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story . i enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set . but what diminished its positives , was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be , to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying . i wished that proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking . 
pi is an earnestly written and directed , low-budget black & white shot sci-fi film that is made for intellectuals , but shows them in a depressing light . the attacks he gets on the nyc subway are particularly horrifying , such as being followed and seeing a brain on the subway platform . its number has served the public well for generations . but our hero is rebellious of this symbol's status quo in society . margolis futilely shouts out that he should go home and relax , and take a bath : that he thinks too much , he should learn how to act more intuitively . the flaw in this intellectualual characterization of gullette , is that the director chooses to end gullette's vision and search , by saying it is not so bad that he took out a piece of his brain because of all the problems he was having , now he can experience the ordinary things of life . what is clear , is that aronofsky blames science , just as much as he does capitalism and religion for the way the world is in turmoil . this is aronofsky's first feature , something he won best director for at the sundance film festival . it is good to see that a film that is so cerebral and difficult to make can so popularly be received by selected audiences and most critics . but this being said , the film's popularity still scares me : i think it is popular for the wrong reason . this film , in retrospect , might be viewed as an anti-intellectual film since it emphasizes that gullette is more appealing when he is not completely absorbed in his intellectual pursuit . just as the film's merits are easy to praise , the film's flaws are easy to find fault with . aronofsky has his protagonist retreating sophomorically into passivity in lieu of his quest ; this flaw should not be overlooked , it so seriously challenges the film's main character from establishing who he is and from our understanding of what is really being said about intellectuals . i think , it should have been emphasized , that it is irrelevant that the protagonist is an intellectual , because he could be any personality type and that would not alter the fact that he was going through a nervous breakdown , and in essence , that is what has happened to gullette , who is just marvelous in this very complex role , in a film that gives off a rich aroma of intellectual pursuit , but cannot digest the full intellectual and mystical meal it has cooked . 
a heavy going and at times annoying , but , nevertheless , embroiling drama . religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the film , as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual liberation in a puritan type of setting . it is easy to realize how difficult it is to break from one's religious traditions if you are raised and indoctrinated with it . the flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused , as too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and comprehend . there just seems to be too much internally going on for any follow-up scenes to uncover all the loose ends that remain untied . the protestant family is way too complicated to gloss over its 19th century life style . the film is too long and boring at times ; and , the love affair was not credible considering the lack of passion ( these lovers were just not a believable match ) ; and , the film hammers out too many far reaching religious themes that it cannot properly address . but the acting and cinemaphotography are superb . her sexually explicit scenes with wilkinson added to the religious tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation , but since i did not find their passion convincing , it was difficult for me to believe that their relationship would have taken place . the governess is an absorbing , marvelously acted film , but not necessarily an entertaining one . 
the story is funny , somewhat romantic , though at times resembling more a tv series like columbo than a movie , but in the end turns back to the private eye genre it started out in . i thoroughly enjoyed this uncanny and inventive caper , except for the unconvincing acting between pullman and kim ( she was too lethargic ) -- which made it difficult for me to get involved with their relationship . zero had a light heartedness about it that was endearing and worthy of that mind solving sherlock holmes genre it so alluringly wanted to emulate , but too lacking in overall integrity to achieve more of an original tone to it , than turn out to be a reasonably witty film , achieved under the direction of the young son of the famous film director . 
what gets into the headlines determines how most of us view the world . emira nusevic plays herself , with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story . since the war is precipitated at this point in history by the serbs , the film has little choice but to point out that the serbs are mainly responsible for what is happening now . what is so forcefully happening in sarajevo , even though it is on the news everyday , has not caught the american people's attention as much as you might think it would . the this film offers an honest portrait of the media in action , as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed . it seems as if the public could care less about what is happening there . so it shouldn't be all that surprising that the public also showed its indifference at the box-office to this heartfelt film . 
for most of us , we have formed an opinion on how we think it works , even if we realize that statistics of arrests and convictions do not tell us the whole story . it is not until we see an actual trial , do we sense how delicate a system we have , how in the hands of forthright , honest , intelligent , and fair-minded participants , the system should work fine , but if that is not so , we better watch out , the system can backfire on us and make us scratch our heads and wonder if it is possible for justice to work . and that is what this objective documentary does , as it allows us into the courtroom to see how the participants do their job . for some reason there is a separate trial for jessie miskelly , the pint sized 17-year-old , who has an iq of 72 , he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner , and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates . just seeing them and hearing their story , and seeing no solid proof put forward , except for innuendo and a coerced confession , is not what i call a solid case against them . the job they did frightened the heck out of me , because of their unwillingness to check everything out , and as much as the crime revolted me , this revolted me with almost equal disdain . this is a knife that could have very likely been used in the crime . jason could hardly say a word , and seems to be mortified , not really aware of what is going on , and appears to have no connection with anything occult , except he likes to hang around with damien and listen to heavy metal music . if ever there was to be a public outcry against how the judicial system works and the arbitrary use of the death penalty , this film should give you food for thought about how unfair the judicial system can be for those who are of the poor class . it was frightening for me to watch how the process works . there is no outcry from the community about injustice , and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate , that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment , which i sincerely doubt , this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed , not only in my questioning of the verdict , but the whole process itself , and wondering if our system is so flawed , that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone , realizing how political all verdicts appear to be . 
this is a mark rappaport film , so if you are expecting to see a convential film , you have walked into the wrong theater . his tongue-in-cheek humor is as always , delightfully absurd . all 9 characters play co-starring roles , with no one dominating the film . and it works , in an odd sort of way , making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene , even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder . this is a film about troubled characters and a chance for rappaport to direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them , as each character is out of it , in a neurotic way . the characters appear in short skits , trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy , spewing out lame jokes and theories , self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies , while many of them are hungering for sex and violence , and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on . that should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this on video . all i could honestly say , is that i enjoyed it . it was like a nice cold drink , on a hot summer day , offering me something for my thirst , as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one , after all , the plot of this film is not completely insane . and as paul so ably says , " everything is a plot , it is just not clear what it is .

this is a mark rappaport film , so if you are expecting to see a convential film , you have walked into the wrong theater . his tongue-in-cheek humor is as always , delightfully absurd . all 9 characters play co-starring roles , with no one dominating the film . and it works , in an odd sort of way , making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene , even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder . this is a film about troubled characters and a chance for rappaport to direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them , as each character is out of it , in a neurotic way . the characters appear in short skits , trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy , spewing out lame jokes and theories , self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies , while many of them are hungering for sex and violence , and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on . that should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this on video . all i could honestly say , is that i enjoyed it . it was like a nice cold drink , on a hot summer day , offering me something for my thirst , as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one , after all , the plot of this film is not completely insane . and as paul so ably says , " everything is a plot , it is just not clear what it is .

the father is paternally played with a very sweet charm , by veteran actor , seymour cassel . this is an original and quirky story , but it also follows a long tradition of films that took similar routes ( ferris bueller's day off , the graduate ) , so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it is going and who max is , cannot be simply or absolutely stated , which is great in some ways but completely mind-blowing in other ways , as this somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than swiss cheese , yet no matter how it seems to be served , it always seems to be a story that is tastefully done . max is not exactly a nerd , as he is pushy , being neither completely likable nor obnoxious , who propels himself into the rushmore scene by pursuing extra-curricular activities to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity , as he is involved in so many diverse activities , that it is a wonder he has time to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus . it is at rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure , entrepenureship , and romance . there are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly told , forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a sane commentary of the going-ons here . these scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend , as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama , and to a certain extent , a temporary suspension of belief . yet it was this facet of the story that was most novel and daring about the film , as it let the characters freely play out who they were without contrivance . therefore , even if you didn't particularly care about the way things were going , you were at least taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other . blume retaliating by smashing the kid's bike . the young director's previous film , bottle rocket , was also written by him with owen wilson , it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done . both films show promise of better things to come . there are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order , but after saying that , i must say that this is still a first-rate film , with a lot of bite to it , depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable . this is bill murray's best role yet , and for newcomer , jason schwartzman , the son of actress talia shire , a role made for him in filmdom heaven . 
even though , arthur miller wrote this film for marilyn , and she was most affecting in this vulnerable role she had , this was possibly the best role gable ever had , excluding gwtw . also , it is interesting to note that this was both clark's and marilyn's last film . clark insisted on doing all the rigorous stunts for the film . if you are looking for that kind of western here , you will not find it , even though you have a director and stars of the film who have been very successful in previous western films , depicting that genre as it has come to be expected . there are no heroes here , only lonely people trying to live with their illusions , just like the audience is trying to see them as they were led to believe cowboys should be like . all this might be confusing for those who never dreamed they would see a western with its stars having psychological problems , and worried about earning a living . that sounds too much like what ordinary people are going through . this is a superior western despite its non-action and debunking of one of cinema's great myths , mainly because of its incisive characterizations of these misfits , and because it was fun watching these big stars work together , especially when realizing that there was a lot of truth in the script that pertained to their real-life situations . 
how do you like to see christ depicted in films ? the wachowski brothers must think they hit upon something really important to convey , because in my book , any film that goes way over two hours in length , thinks of itself as important , and by earmarking the young literate computer age audience to buy into their intellectual sci-fi'er , as they flatter them by telling them that it is only at a young age that one can develop the ability to have a chance of understanding the message delivered here , they have done just that , making me wonder how they expect adults to react to their film . and the good news the film brings , is that " the one " is alive , as prophesized in the bible . as the filmmakers get involved in their little pseudo-philosophy game of what's real and what isn't , promising those with an open mind a chance to be unplugged , to find out what is real . i think , they really believe they will get unplugged , mainly , because they had the good sense to pay money to see the movie . what the wachowski brothers are good at is style and visuals , and what we see on screen is ground breaking fun to watch , in the form of exhilarating camera work from the opening sequence onwards , as a mixture of kung-fu and sci-fi schmaltz is used , which is as entertaining as it is ominously intellectually pretentious , as a computer hacker named trinity ( moss ) , she is a take off on mary magdalene , which is why there is no sex between her and neo , just intent eye contact , as she uses her kung-fu and super-natural skills , just like its done in the comics , to escape from a police trap , that comes by way of info an informer gave them . all that talk , all those explanations , every bit of pseodo- philosophical occultism is pulled out of the hat to make the story plausible , except the more rationally it is explained by the group's leader , morpheus , the more holes in his story are opened up , and the judas in his group , who only wants to return to the matrix , in his old job at the factory , is tired of all this hype after nine years of eating the same slop , is played by cypher ( joe ) , now eating a juicy steak with the agents and declaring ignorance is bliss , seems to make as much sense as the mumbo-jumbo morpheus is talking about . as morpheus explains all this to neo , who believe me , if you just take one look at him , no one in his right mind would mistake him for even one second , as " the one . " i don't think he even has time to go out and see an escapist sci-fi film , just for kicks . it is serious business saving the world , with not many people even willing to thank you for your effort . but he , at least , found morpheus , the one he was searching for , but as an interesting twist in the story , it was morpheus who was looking for him . you will only get questions in this film , not answers . but one of the questions is , from what source do the questions come from , and that is answered in an interview with the directors , i read in the film 'zine , american cinematographer , as the wachowski brothers freely talked about what kind of film they were trying to make and who influenced them . the film ends with neo , looking like clark kent , as he is stepping out of a telephone booth , to give the film the full comic book flavor it deserves , as if superman is there , already in place , ready to stop the bad guys . for the film's point of reference to anything resembling theology and theory , it was jean baudrillard's simulacra and simulation that was used as reference material , referring to his take on ecclessiastics . he is the modern french philospher , with his theories of time as unreal and his critique of hyperreality and how the truth can't be reached , but violence can , that influenced the wachowski brothers in the making of this film . but even more than a biblical film ( though if you are looking for this to be a spiritual film , there are plenty of symbols in the film to allude to this being so ) , or another look at the world of lewis carroll's alice in wonderland , this is a computer-age film , that questions if we have just become batteries for our computers , who have evolved past us in their knowledge of the world . and the only intellectual question we may be left to ask ourselves , if we take the new myth presented here seriously , is who needs christ when we got superman , or do we need neither or both , or do we just need christ ? 
as for me , i'm not partial to these pentecostal preachers and their heavy handed , pushy methods of self-righteousness . to watch a movie , which almost imitates a church service in length and purpose , is not particularly entertaining or spiritual for my tastes . what this film does very well , is examine the character of the man preaching , and what affect religion has on the people . duvall is sonny , the apostle . if we didn't live in a society where so many folks think like him and mistakeningly and arrogantly take the letter of the bible as gospel , then he would be considered a certifiable nut case . what duvall has is zeal , he is a non-stop talker , always railing on about jesus and satan , quoting scriptures , offering up the whole evangelical bag of tricks . that he is good at it , is not the question . that he is annoying , except to those who need to be with someone like him , someone who is demonstrative in his praise of god , someone who can make them feel good about themselves , even if they are a sinner and a lost soul , is another thing . these unevangelical moments , of him on a date with her , talking real talk , were gems , and these scenes made the film a more enjoyable experience . it was also fun to watch duvall smile , because as good an actor as he is , and he is one of the good ones , his friendly smile always has a trace of cruelty around the edges . it seems he can only play parts where he is all wired up , frenetically moving in every scene . in this film , he has created a work that tries to be more than entertaining , reaching for a more artistic film . as for me , i live not to be preached to . what made the picture dull for me , is the subject matter . but what excites me about this film , is that i believe it has a truth to it , that can't be denied ; and that , duvall has accomplished a virtuoso performance , supported by some excellent actors in supporting roles and non-professional actors giving the film an intimacy and a flavor to it that is special . 
la femme nikita ( director : luc bresson ; cast : anne parillaud , jean-hughes anglade , tcheky karyo , jean reno , jeanne moreau , 1990-fr . ) an exciting and entertaining actioner that tests the plausibility of its story with an unreality check , yet is real on its emotional levels , testing the heroine's reactions to love , guilt , loss of identity , and a deprived upbringing , which is rare for this genre to be so concerned with actual human values . anne , the wife of luc , plays nikita with a flair , exhibiting the tremendous energy and orneriness needed to make the part exceptional . the film plays like an mtv special , using a splash of coloring to light up the screen and very fast paced action sequences to keep you mindlessly glued to the screen . but that is disarming , since this film has more than that to offer , even if it does not seem so during certain stretches of the film . it is worth sticking with this film , it gets better and less predictable the more you get into it . though its ending , does leave a lot to be desired . this part of the story lags , as we watch how this violent misfit channels her anti-social aggressiveness into acceptibility for her new role in life , one that society , supposedly , can appreciate . there is one great scene where we see the young nikita putting on makeup next to moreau , and we are dazzled by looking at the faces of the two stars fill-up the screen , with moreau , wrinkles and all , still looking quite sexy and alluring , and in my way of looking at things , the one who is the more alluring . so , we have come full cycle , and nikita has developed an appreciation for life that she never had before , leaving us with much moral fodder to chew on , more than most actioners leave us with , and we come to the understanding that this incredible story , that is hardly plausible , that is seemingly cartoonish , is much better than it appears on surface because somehow or other it satisfies our need to know something about covert operations and the people who go into it on a non-voluntary basis , plus the movie is very entertaining and was able to hold our attention , even through the rough spots in it . 
this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story , as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can't become real , without any particular message to deliver , except that these two have their hands full coping with their life , as it seems , it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive . since they consider themselves artists , they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show , an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem , as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out . since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously , yet it is quite evident , that he , alone , has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don't have . a chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product , but the important thing is , if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it . that his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first , then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate , so his sale becomes an easy one . though , what stands out , is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way , that there public appearance might seem calm and collected , but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life . this thought provoking film , touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity , but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness , that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely , as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically , pointing out that maybe , that is all one can hope for , yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up , that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation . 
she , in fact , looks a lot like the director . so we can guess that some of these horrible experiences are something that might have happened to him in puberty . this loner theme is belabored and beaten into the story , so much so , that the obvious couldn't be made more obvious . there are no subtle messages . there is , also , no revenge of the nerd , or any analytical probes into what she can do about her low self-esteem ( and i am most grateful for that ) . this is simply a film that looks at why schools and families , for the most part , impart no concern about " culture " in the children they teach and raise , and why they can't respond with civility and intelligence to those students who need the most help that they can get . and the response is given so bluntly : " because you are so ugly . " he acts more like he was an adult than a teenager , even the rock band he starts , is not a rebellious one , but he does it because it will look good on his resume for college . in any case , whatever she does seems pathetic , and even though she is very smart , she does not do well in school . since the film sinks or swims , depending on how credible heather is in depicting this unhappy youngster with her vulnerabilities , it is safe to say that she fitted the role perfectly . there was no place to go in developing heather's character by adding these major societal problems to heather's story , that's for another film . solondz knows his subject well , he is able to understand and convey what it is to be brought up with self-hatred and how such people can react by being sometimes just as cruel as the society they are a product of , and the result is an unusual movie that focuses in on a subject very few filmmakers have chosen to do . 
as the one giving the orders , the big boss , he is a less portly version of sydney greenstreet , playing the type of role once reserved for the mirthful greenstreet . don't ask too much more about the plot , it is not particularly pertinent , and some explanations about what this film is about , were obviously snipped off at the cutting room . but an unclear story and poor dubbing quality of most of the non-english speaking actors , does not really hamper the absurdity presented on screen , because it is done in such a way , that it defies any critical commentary , having a dark humor about it that is funnier than hell . chabrol has gone to absurd extremes of humor in this commercially driven screwball comic/mystery , that has the agents working for the greek government , at least i think that is who they are working for . the one in charge of them , is a lazy , sleazy , and mediocre bureaucrat , named sharp ( bouquet ) , aptly named because he is a dull wit , who is clueless about what is going on , as he confronts the two agents working for him , the imaginative but usually wrong , robert , and the more steady dex ( ronet ) , who like sharp , has his eye on robert's appealing wife , shanny , only he doesn't get his face slapped like sharp does by her , as sharp makes too much of an overt pass at her . jean seberg , the much maligned actress , is just terrific in this breezy role , showing a certain amount of vulnerability and courage and sex appeal , and an eye for comic timing , as she takes over for robert when he is killed just before he was going to tell her the info he has about the black boxes , and they were to celebrate the news with champagne and love making . the road to corinthe , the european title for the film , is the road to the marble foundry owned by kalhides . it is the place where there is this great mix of intrigue and murder and comedy , as the black boxes are discovered there , hidden in the statues' heads , and as kalhides says , if you think i'm not imaginative enough to put them someplace else , you are wrong , because some of them i have put in the base of the statue . it is a wonderful b movie experience , that rips deliciously into the spy film genre and comes away with a bundle of laughs for all its awkwardness and a ridiculous ending to a story that fails to make much sense . i think chabrol hit it best , when the opening epigraph states , " i do not ask you to believe it , but i suggest that you dream about it . " well , maybe , you don't want to dream about it , but if you daydream about it during the time of day when you are a little bored with things or upset over something , the absurdity of this film should bring a smile to you . 
in this movie , that goes beyond the boundaries of what a movie is , because it has become a trademark name that is as easily recognized as any popular brand name is ; if i mentioned kfc , you would know that i am talking about a fast-food chain that sells fried chicken ( ugh ! ) , and if i mentioned star wars ( ah ! ) , the same familiarity would ring a bell with you . since the movie first surfaced in 1977 , it has been a very popular film , basically over-taking many other types of films that took on the moral battle of good and evil , such as the western , and it created a new myth that does not challenge the old myth , but incorporates pieces of mythology not only from the judeo-christian roots of the bible , but from the eastern religions , as well . it has become so commercially successful a film and enterprise , that even though the film cost about 115 million dollars to make , its profit margin is a sure thing , since it has merchandise deals tied into its release , that are estimated to be around 3 . 5 billion dollars . with this in mind , there can be no ordinary viewing of this film , since it is already hyped and promoted beyond any reasonable level of expectation , it is therefore hardly likely that it could meet such expectations , even with its fanatical fan base , willing to stand on long lines for a long time in order to get tickets and who will most likely see the film a number of a times , and a public that is primed and ready for the product . how many times will viewers want to see it , is hard to gauge at this early date , though what is guaranteed , is that it will draw large crowds and pump life into the movie industry , as many will see this film as an event , therefore making it critic-proof and ensured of being a legendary film no matter what might be perceived of it on screen . what takes place on screen , if i can consider myself , a voice of moderation on this subject , is not as terrible a storyline and acting job as one could be led to believe by listening to some film critics , nor is it as great a film as many unabashed fans might think , who feel taken with the innovative special-effects , and are really caught up in the aura and excessive exuberance the total film's package presents to them , from john william's recognizable star war themes , to some original musical scores he added , as special for the film . there should be something in this film for everybody to like , especially in a thx theater , where the digital sound system and wide screen is best suited for viewing it . the tremendous effort put into the details and scope of its project , makes it seem stupendous at times , and , even throughout the film , when there are lulls in its story , it still sets a very galactic mood , that is trance-like and illusionary in a positive hypnotic sense , but it does suffer , at times , from being too talky and lacking enough emotions and depth in its story and in its characters , and is scripted with a banal dialogue , plus there is no romance in it , which makes it a film that is more geared to a younger audience , an audience that will be around to follow all the other episodes that will surely come forth . as a positive feature of the film , it is not interested in gratuitous violence , and for that it scores high marks , as there is no blood in it , as all the action scenes involve mostly robotic things being dismantled . the pace of the film picks up with its most innovative addition , an exciting and , i might add , dizzying racing sequence featuring " pod " space ships , as ani has to win the race to gain freedom for himself and for the jedis to get their needed space craft parts , as a wager is made with ani's junkman boss on the pod race . this is pure video game stuff , that should thrill its younger audience , perhaps more than it did me , but it was effective and added something new to the star wars legend . delving into the evil nature of politics , there is the dual role played by ian mcdiarmid , as senator palpatine/darth sidious , cast perfectly as a shadowy villain and a hypocritical senator , who in future episodes will become emperor palpatine and should provide more chills for viewer's to reckon with . without its frightening villains , star wars would be stripped of its soul . some of the actors did not impress me enough as the above mentioned . it is probably not fair and not nice to criticize a youngster like jake lloyd who plays anakin skywalker , but i thought , that though he was sometimes bearable to see on the screen , as when he played with his computer toys , he was , nevertheless , miscast and did not have the skills to pull off the difficult role he was asked to fulfill . anikin's mother , the great swedish actress , pernilla august , is just right for the part ; in fact , she is too good for the part , because she makes the boy seem very amateurish and not caring enough when he is teamed with her and can't respond with the proper emotional responses expected from his role , while she is fluid and graceful in her role , even though she is stuck in a wooden part . there were non-distinguished cameos by samuel l . jackson and terrence stamp , that have neither added nor distracted anything from the film . i would have preferred seeing unknown actors in those minor roles , giving them a chance to get known and earn some " bread . " some of the more exciting scenes , that weren't crammed too tight with every computerized gizmo lucas could throw at us , so that we were literally choking on too much alien and droid consumption , came from the just gorgeous and eye pleasing set designs on the planets , such as the submerged underwater city on naboo , filled with dangerous sea monsters , and a coliseum-like stadium on tatooine , where the " pod race " transpired , covered by talking head sport's personalities . its soaring skyscrapers and a sky filled with exotic spaceships and its views of the world , that was just too stunning to fully grasp . all these space landscapes gave the film all the color and spectacle it could ever need , making it a most entertaining and enjoyable movie experience , which is really what this movie is all about anyway , since i find it difficult to get too worked up over its so called " new mythology , " joseph campbell blessed or not , since this movie only expresses what is just a shell of what myths can mean to a society . be that it as it may , i do understand that many feel that what is missing in today's society , is some kind of positive myth , that there is something that has gone wrong with our culture , and this film does offer some encouragement for those who feel movies have caused a certain amount of degeneracy in this country's cultural war , and they should be pleased that lucas's film reasserts , his personal belief , that good can triumph over evil , as many feel restless and unsure about the world they live in and need reassurance that we have the same positive values other generations of americans have had , and they should look forward to seeing a film such as this one , that has such a rosy outlook . it is a movie about the taming of nature in the future but made for the age we live in , and will be remembered by future movie viewers , not for its trite dialogue , but as a step up the ladder in our technical and computer skills , and in our deep yearnings to find hope in the world we live in . it seems regretable that we have to wait three more years for the next installment of these episodes to be released . i would say that this imperfect film , is still , a not-to-be missed film , and even if it has become tied-in with corporate america , nevertheless , george lucas used his great technical skills to make this film as artistically good looking as he could , not aiming to make an exploitive film . and for that , we should all be grateful . i have immensely enjoyed the film for what it was and was not overly concerned about what it was not . i think it is fair to say , that when you plunk down your money and see this film , you will be getting your money's worth . " may the force be with you ! " 
in it he questions american values , suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice person than to win and stand for nothing but your own self-aggrandizement . she becomes the easily recognizable villain in payne's satire of american society . makes harelik's love for her seem highly improbable . paul is one of those rich kids who is very nice and very popular , but who is not a very sophisticated or manipulative person . in some ways , this film reminded me of two diverse recent films i saw , welcome to the dollhouse and rushmore . they all had an anger to them , pointing at something in society that is not all that it appears to be and saying that is where the problem lies . in this screenplay , by payne and jim taylor , it has accurately captured a certain look and feel high school has about it . this film was able to show how its school was not conducive for the individual to feel free in . that all the characters are flawed , unable to see beyond the very narrow limits they operate under has made for a very trying tale . the film just didn't know how to end its story by landing on its feet . it had a great performance by matthew broderick , who was subtle and obvious enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life . yet , the main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the characters involved , there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma that is presented . 
it is adapted from a semi-autobiographical book written as a teenager in the '50s , for a national literary contest , by john kennedy toole . when this slow-moving film works , and it often does , it is artistically and subtly satisfying to behold , as it spins its simple story in flashback . all this drama is played out quietly . the the film ends abruptly and magnificently , without a summation of what might happen to david . how this child grew up during that period of transitional southern history , in a climate of racial bigotry and christian hypocrisy , in a family with obvious economic , psychological , and cultural problems , sets the mood for this dramatic story . the cinematography was beautifully done . gena rowlands was impressive in a very subtle performance . jacob tierney as david , gave his character softness and breath in a laconic performance . the only problem i have with his performance , is that since this is his life story being told , he seems to be too emotionless . i found that hard to fathom ; if it was me on that nighttime train , alone , going to who knows where , as my brief life passes before me , i would have certainly been more animated about the situation i was in . this film is not davies' best film , it was too dull at times for that ; but , it is a solid film , an honestly done effort that was well-researched and presented . it offered an interesting observation about the rural south , that is often filmed , but most of the time , it is done with less tact than how it was done here and with less of a real artistic touch . 
but how else can you explain billy as anything but absurd . some people call that love . the film throws its bowling ball into the gutter a few times , as it belabors its points about sexual repression and phobias . she is the best character in this film . the comedic edge to the story works well , though at times the film is too arty . it is as if , vincent , as the director , is trying to beat us over the head with the point he is making about billy's life being a constant foul-up . . . this is an uneven but successful film debut for vincent , both as a director and as a star . 
skarsgard's chilling performance does a pyschological number on his character , and the mysterious and soberly colorful norwegian atmosphere gives this film an appealing flavor , allowing it to appear as if were a noir film . this more than makes up for the less than appealing story line . it is worth a look , if for no other reason , than to see how a murder is handled in a beautiful and idyllic country such as norway . but this film has more to offer than that ; it seriously questions police conduct and authority , as it leaves a very damaging message , something that is hard to ignore about authority figures the world-over : questioning if the police are mentally fit for the work they do . 
and that's the gist of the plot for this sophisticated and superbly acted romance story , that turns the tables on the old notion that the man controls the destiny of the household . because of the expressiveness and raw emotions of the stars , as they go through all kinds of mood swings and power plays until they resolve this very ticklish and perplexing problem they face , we are confronted with a situation whereas pierre has done nothing ghastly to ruin the marriage and the couple still profess a love for each other , yet they are undergoing a separation . his quiet manner , hurt expression , and look of bewilderment says it all . " in a couple , one suffers and the other one's bored , and vice versa . " it now becomes a question if they can weather this storm and the bitterness that is so much a part of their love . a pivotal scene is when the verbal fighting , accusations and hitting take place , that was really unexpected from this urbane couple , except we see it building up and festering inside the stricken pierre . the director wisely doesn't give us too much information about her lover or the details of their love life . that more or less sums up the direction the director was going with this one , by trying to explain the imponderable reason for the snag in their marriage due to a lack of communication . this is an intelligent film , told from the point of view of the man , though this film is not as powerful as paul cox's similar type of film " my first wife . " its huge plus , however , is that it avoids the use of cliches usually reserved for explaining why a couple is breaking up and plays up the small petty things in a relationship that strain one's nerves . this marriage-go-round leaves us off in familiar territory . most of us know how it feels to be unsure of someone we love . and it stings . this work is a testament to a confused couple who are sensible enough to face things that are unpleasant to them in a forthright manner without covering it up . it is only the real good directors , as evidently christian vincent is , who can pull off such an imbroglio with everything turning out to be in a daze for them ; but , nevertheless , ending up intact . 
this is werner herzog's first feature and is easily his most conventional story to date ; which , nevertheless , results in a rather interesting drama even if it is a somewhat heavy handed metaphoric one when it relates the mental breakdown of stroszek to the irrationality of war . there is nothing for the soldiers to do on this barren island , with its torrid greek sun bearing down on them , which makes their stay here seem like an imprisonment . but he is going off on lethargic mood swings , where he can't function for long periods at a time . but the soldiers don't buy into his story , even though his life story is probably more real than theirs . when a piano player plays chopin and tells them how chopin was really mean in his music contrary to the way most interpret his work , we see for ourselves how this music seems to have a dizzying affect on stroszek , who is beginning to show some serious signs of cracking . herzog's characters exhibited many bizarre touches that made them full of life , certainly different from any american film about nazi soldiers . these soldiers seemed like flawed human beings , trapped by the environment they were in and their own idiosyncratic nature , all of which made this ordinary film seem rather special and well-worth taking note of . 
it is a most relaxed and enjoyable look at the neurotic comic , who appears to be no different than he is in his films . but what is vividly shown , is how exhilerated he gets from playing the clarinet and how wonderfully morbid he is about everything he does , from eating a vulcanized spanish omelet in spain to getting seasick on a gondola in venice . you can't help but realize that this is really woody , it is not a put on , and you either love him or shy away from him . some of the snippets from the numbers he played included the joyous songs like " down by the riverside " and " home sweet home . " if there is any criticism for the film , it could be noted that we didn't hear enough of the band playing . there are good vibes there , as they all seem to be on the same page . what might be surprising to a lot of people , is how good the band actually is and how much fun they seem to have playing together . that he receives an engraved plaque for this , encourages woody to joke about how it comes easy for him to be a hero . woody comments that he is always wants to be somewhere he isn't , if he is in milan , he wants to be in new york , if he is in new york , he might want to be in paris . 
the title comes from the markings found on packages delivered by the postal service . the inspiration of the film comes from the studio-like hollywood musicals of the '50s . his other influences are the great french directors of the past , such as renoir and vigo . i rented up down fragile , along with rivette's first feature , paris belongs to us ( 1960 ) , and it was interesting to see how rivette kept some of the same themes , how one has the need to be alone and also the need to be with a group , how one handles reality and fantasy , and the politics of being . in his newer film , which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and well-done production than the former , we see these themes come out clearer , brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis , as they each collaborate on the script , as he gets them to improvise in their roles . the film follows the life of its three main characters : ninon ( natashe ) , louise ( marianne ) , and ida ( laurence ) , as they try to work out their many problems in life , occasionally breaking out in song and dance at the oddest moments , even when the film is moving along in a dramatic fashion . this lighthearted approach to the film annoyed me on my first viewing , but when i watched the film for a second time , i felt more relaxed and was able to get in the mood rivette probably intended for his film to be viewed ; which is , that it is up to me to fill in the meaning of the story . but , this also , allowed me not to take this film as a very serious work but more or less as a spectacle in the hollywood tradition , a tradition that rivette gladly acknowledges a kinship and admiration for . its entertainment value was enhanced by the gorgeous use of colors , which captured the summertime paris streets and parks , as well as the beautful indoor sets . we followed the moped messenger , ex-whore , ninon , do her deliveries . that this musical is better than most of the hollywood musicals it flatteringly immitates , is true to a certain extent . it is better in the sense , that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the real-life situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing . though the hollywood performers are more professional and have better voices and quicker feet , is certainly true , but they also , seem to rely on an artificial story . while for rivette , as amateur as his performers might seem to be in comparison , the story still seems real and important , and the musical numbers are intrusive but seem to be imbued with a magical quality about them , that makes them seem just as fantasy oriented as the typical hollywood production ; and , in my opinion , that makes for a more interesting and better film . though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical , a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of , but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts . 
the movie is a mixture of their music , lifestyles , and an apolitical , quick peek at an impoverished havana . it is done in a wonderfully nostalgic manner , as wenders becomes an admiring fan of theirs , allowing us to see how humble and human these most talented musical souls are . wenders has done a good job highlighting them , though i would have liked to have seen more of their music as performed in carnegie hall , instead of seeing an overabundance of shots showing how well they were received there and how appreciative they were of that rousing welcome . he didn't even own a piano before the film was made . their genuine camaraderie for each other and love of country and gentleness , shines through as much as all the wonderful music they play . fire ! i'm burning up . call the fireman ! they tell each other , it doesn't get any better than this . i wonder how much longer castro's communist revolution will go on ! 
one of the better sci-fi'ers to emerge from the 1950s . the only part of the film that is in color , is the red letters of the title . no money is taken , only sugar . go figure its ants that did this ! so you can't blame sgt . since the girl's father was a f . b . i . agent on vacation , this makes it a federal crime and the f . b . i . it is these constant little touches throughout the film , more so than the special effects , that make this film come to life . this film was intelligently presented , the special effects were effective enough , and the cast , especially edmund gwenn , all provided fine performances , all this adding up to a really decent and subtle film . 
while at the beauty parlor , she is interviewed for the film , filling us in with a more complete look at lenny , as she provided anecdotes , snapshots and home films of him and recalled how he was a quiet child who could have fits of melancholy , but was a happy-go-lucky person most of the time . he also made what he calls a z- film with his wife and friends , a funny low-budget crime film that showed he basically was like the other comics , willing to do anything for a laugh . and that , even though , he had the comedian mentality of just going after the laugh , he was still able to develop into being something more than your typical comedian . it became his obsession in life and caused this once slick hipster to sadly be seen losing his cool demeanor . lenny felt , " it's become chic to arrest me . '' please don't lock up these words . " 
the film was powerful enough in its political jibes to have made the state and the church and the opposition party condemn it . though this is not the director's top-of-the line artistic work , it does fit positively into his opus . it seemed awkward and out of place in this straight forward film , whose darkened cameras captured enough of the sobering mood of poland for the story to be a compelling one , a story about the unfinished business of the struggle for freedom . 
the b/w film starts off fast-paced and never stops to catch its breath . this comes about after there is an actual lineup in the film , as all the ship's porters are brought in so that dressler could identify the one who threw his luggage in the cab . but since the rather snooty dressler was not observant of these lower-class types , he was unable to pick the porter out of the lineup . these two psychopaths are real beauties , and give the film the kind of quirkiness that keeps its brutal scenes counterbalanced with a nice edge of verbal nastiness . warner's last words , duly noted for julian's benefit are , " why be greedy ? " this film is not noteworthy for its sadistic story , but what makes it rise above the ordinary b movie , is the strangely provocative dialogue and the utter depravity of all the criminals , who are shown in all their ugliness and unredeeming features . the outcome shows that they can't rise to another social level despite all their efforts to polish dancer's image . 
a great labyrinth plot , ala hitchcock , as mamet delves into the greedy corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter competition , and dangles this world in front of us , with all its perks and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate types . this nearly perfectly executed film , never fails to surprise and it accomplishes this by telling an old-fashioned story without one explicit sex scene or one single curse word , earning it a pg rating . the chink in the story's armor is , when you see how it ends , you realize it doesn't add up . the fun seems to be in the telling of the story and not in the story itself making sense . this is a masterfully crafted thriller for the '90s and its new values and lingo . steve martin ( that's right , pal ) steals the film with his stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his persona . this something , 'the process , ' is what should put him figuratively on 'easy street . ' 'the process' is a mcguffin , a hitchcock invented term , it is something to focus your attention on without knowing what it really is . its explanation for the movie is that it has something to do with a formula that can control the global market . but what mamet really is showing , is greed and how that poisonous desire makes the world spin . this is pointed out when the board members of a company want to know how much they will earn from investing in it and joe writes the supposed astronomical figure on a blackboard , which the audience is not privileged to see but is supposed to be impressed by it through the response taken from watching the widening eyes of the board members . this pulls him very close to the audience , as they identify with him and his situation , even if it is hardly possible that they themselves would ever be in such a position . this is the kind of hero that speaks realistically to what could happen to anyone in today's work place , especially to someone who doesn't play the corporate game , and who doesn't know that the first axiom in business for the dishonest types , is always do business as if someone is trying to screw you . in this film , it has nothing to do with spain or a prisoner . this tale is more frightening than a hundred action films put together . it is eerie because the innocent hero asks , during one of his low points , " why steal what others worked for ? " it is a film that earnestly asks , `why is it that nobody in this world is what they seem ? ' has mamet really ended the film by tying up all the loose ends and leaving us with the kind of ending we as an audience wanted ? and the answer is . . . maybe . this is a film for people who like to use their noodle and are able to appreciate films that can't be tidied up so easily . even the so-called tidy ending here might not be as tidy as it first appears , if you look carefully you will spot some loose ends . 
in his forceful and blunt way , hiding his violent tendencies with the warmest smile in st . petersburg , he professes to have a real romantic interest in her , sincerely sympathizing with her that men are often beating her up . she seems to so passively accept her beatings as part of her life , which i guess is symbolic of how russia treats its women . everything that we learn about the new russian attitudes comes from seeing it through danila's naive eyes . this scene for one thing tells how xenophobic the russians have always been and still are . his mindlessness and quiet charm , and the heroic qualities he often displays , are both chilling and pitiful to observe . if anything , this slickly done gangster thriller , should be taken as a political warning by the west that russia is a wounded animal and still dangerous , and a wounded animal is frightened and will often do anything to lash out at those it perceives as hurting it . there were many diverting scenes that make that point crystal clear . his performance gives the film a reverberating force , depicting the chaos currently going on in a deteriorating country , and how difficult it would be to reach someone like him , when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by tuning out what he doesn't want to hear . it is in his soul that rests the centuries of russia's life of misery and war , whose struggle is never over but always seems to be just beginning . he has infused the film with a raw power , that touches the nerves of the things that westerners understand the least about the russians . all this makes for a fascinating film , one that is popular in russia , and is quite different from the usual russian films exported to america . it is one of the most insightful films i have seen about modern russia and how organized crime has taken a foothold in the country . it is a film that has its finger on the problems the severe economic decay in russia and the rise of criminals to fill the void of a lost morality , has caused . this film has the look and tone of those old american b movies , but with a little more depth in its political aims and much more pessimism for its country'sfuture . 
so it is with rohmer , who in actuality might not be such an exacting realist as first thought , but more of an artist who happens to be a realist , perhaps in the mode of a monet , whose artistic work is appreciated because his water lilies mean more to him and should to us than just the flowers they are . this is a very ordinary love story between middle-aged lonely people who are unable to make a connection with someone else , even though they are people who have a lot to give and are far from being losers . for rohmer , being moral is simply living as simply as one would : being natural . being a french film , it is very chatty . it also takes a long time to develop as it makes sure that we understand all the people involved and what kind of philosophy about life they have , before we come to the crux of the story . how the people speak and how they react to the ordinary things in life , is really what rohmer is interested in . it is what gives this film its flavor and distinguishes its director from others of the french new wave , of which he is a part of . to watch a rohmer film like he intended it to be observed , is to take in the magnificence of the natural , whether it is the opening of the film when we are introduced to the town's older white buildings , as the light falls against them and contrasts its whiteness with its black shadows or if we view the verdant fall colors of the countryside and its sense of a cultivated peace as the sun shines on it . this sense of beauty has stood the test of time and is worth savoring . but her matchmaking doesn't work because there is no chemistry them . what is most endearing about the film , even if it is a bourgeois tale , is that it has a french charm to it and a deep-seated respect for all the people involved . that the amorous professor and the playful and impulsive rosine and the dull leo are shown in equal terms with the industrious magali and the elegant isabelle and the sincere salesman g ? rald , which is a sly way of telling the story in a non-judgmental way . there's much to recommend in this film that feels right and touches a sore subject that should interest mostly those in their forties and later years of life ; what the story lacks is a great deal of imagination and a something more substantial in it to make the modest story have something more to say than it does . the film only goes so far in being realistic before it has to resort to farcical contrivances to keep our interests . but even if it is not always interesting , it does keep us on our toes rooting for the nice winemaker to come up with something more than a bumper crop . this was rohmer's fourth and final film about the seasonal cycle , and it might be the best one , letting in the most sunlight and being very pleasurable to watch , highlighted by fine acting by all concerned . by the time the film ends , we have the feeling that we really know these individuals , it is as if we met them in real life and they have become our acquaintances . 
the children , despite their discontentments with the outside world , are almost mirror images of their empty parents , unwilling to be honest with themselves , or too honest with themselves for their own good . the ice storm is magnificently opulent in its whitish , blueish , and gray colors ( the ice was artificially made , but it looks only too real ) . it symbolically represents the truth that can't be denied , no matter what games the adults ( wife-swapping ) and children ( touching their private parts ) play . the beauty of the ice storm is even more menacing and attractive when it is added to the more placid beauty of the town's countryside ; but it is also dangerous , as we see how the one surbanite truly influenced by the beauty of the storm , also succumbs to it . it is amazing that this film was made by a foreigner , who is able to get into some of the nuances that pricked the skin of those living through those times ( it still surprises me , though hollywood has a rich history of foreigners doing just that , examples would be , messieurs lang and sirk ) . the characters are intricately drawn together , but each is complex and not reduced to being a caricature . ricci's performance is simply breathtaking in its verve , as she appears to be the only one of the teen group who really feels what is going on politically and socially . this film is to be admired for its vividly icy observations of suburban life , letting us clearly see the intensity and restlessness that lies behind the carefully manicured personas of the rich . its use of the ice storm's raw power , in all its beauty and danger , as a metaphor on the dysfunctionality of the characters , were both well-utilized and , at the same time , utilized too much . the ice storm came to symbolize what can so easily be taken away from any one , in one rapid moment , if one is not prudent or careful in their life . the film can be slightly faulted for putting too much weight on the ice storm and its symbolical message , and for trying to make too much of the comparison between the children and the parents , thereby not doing enough justice to either , as the characterizations tended to appear to be too forced into fitting in with the metaphor of the ice storm . 
a delightful screwball comedy , making use of sci-fi gimmicks to bolster its story . willie plays the role with rolling eyeballs and other gestures that smack of a stereotyped racism that is upsetting to many of today's african-americans . when willie sees the invisible man , he exclaims , " well , cut off my legs and call me shorty . " this 72 minute film is the kind of old-fashioned comedy that can cheer you up with a few laughs if you are down , or if you are in a silly mood make you feel even sillier . it's a classic . 
my sex life ( or how to get into an argument ) [comment je me suis dispute . . . some might find this appealing film about parisian twenty-somethings , who refuse to grow up , to be quite amusing . these troubled student-intellectual types love to talk and are charmingly neurotic , in a film that unjustifiably goes on for three hours but does so in a surprisingly breezy fashion . i would have more carefully edited this film , as there were too many scenes that were nice but not impactful enough to keep . what the film does just right , that caught my interest from a psychological point of view : is penetrate the students' loneliness , the mind-games they play , their ideas about sex and love , their foolish need to lie , and the tribal nature of their relationships . these sort of devilish characters could be very attractive to the opposite sex , especially if they are handsome like he is and equipped with a facade of sensitivity and innate intelligence . you see , he thinks he loves another girl even more , sylvia ( denicourt ) , whose performance steals the film because of her unwitting sexual charm being displayed in such a capricious manner . nathan does not know that he knew sylvia before , which should tell you something about their close friendship . this really fine ensemble cast takes this meandering , real-life type of a story and makes it into an absorbing drama , carefully scrutinizing their intricate and confusing lives . val ? rie is very demanding , and suffers from being a bit metally unbalanced . jeanne balibar gives an eye-catching performance , one that adds just the right degree of spice to the meal being cooked . there are a few diverting subplots that are deftly handled by the director , as paul is snubbed by his pretentious ex-friend rabier ( vuillermoz ) , who becomes to his chagrin , head of the epistemology department at the university . what the film fails to do , after one may grow weary of all the charm it exudes , is provide any rationalizations or explanations for the split-ups and ongoing relationships . there are no shared intimacies , or greater emotional or intellectual depths explored . but the film is still a rather compelling and superbly acted-out black comedy , that has its glorious moments , but cannot go past its own facile limits it set-for- itself . 
it is a politically oppressive climate in the madrid of the 1970s , with the dictator franco in power . there are too many coincidences for me to be wholly convinced that i am not being manipulated into accepting a story with a certain political agenda to it , but there are so many wonderful gripping and beautifully done scenes , that i found i was taken in by the relationships going on and curious about what would happen to these folks , and glad that almodovar ( dark habits , high heels , women on the verge of a nervous breakdown ) has chosen to make a film this time that has a story that makes some sense . i found most of his other films to be basically sexually bizarre , with storylines that were not particularly lucid . clara , who is only a minor figure in this story , nevertheless , her story is the one that moved me the most . his story is the most challenging one , and the one that is hardest to comprehend . almodovar has shot a sophisticated film about characters who really develop character-wise and who are in-tune with the times they live in . this film is definetly one of almodovar's more resolute efforts . 
and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . what can one expect out of life ? the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . 
she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! 
racial hatred is something that we are not born with . films of this nature are very difficult to do ; firstly , because they tend to become merely message vehicles and , secondly , hatred is a mindset that must be unlearned and films tend to think that they must sermonize to get their good intentions across and sermons as a rule do not make for pleasing dramatics . when this film is most effective , it goes for the jugular of its racist veins and pulls back no punches , using lucid arguments about why there is racial disharmony in this country and it does so in the language used on the street . when it backtracks and feels that it has to explain itself and sort of apologize for what it has shown , and allows the main character off the racial hook rather abruptly , the story seems to weaken and become somewhat artificial like so many other films of this ilk , afraid to let completely go and allow the chips to fly where they may . what the producers of the film might be afraid of , is that the message about why youngsters become racists was too convincingly done , that their gripes are too reasonable and might leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those who can't face the realities of life in contemporary america . that this is a country where so many of the nasty newspaper headlines seem to be about racial problems ; and , also , this is a country that is consumed by its bad karma from its past racial history to its unsettling now and it is thereby impossible to hide from these problems wherever one lives in this country . this film convincingly exploits this racial tension , up to a point , as it tantalizes the audience with a reality that is lived out for real in many of the viewer's everyday lives , as many of them are the innocent ones caught in the cross-fire of those extreme racists on both sides of the color line . so one of the questions that crosses my mind , is what can this film add to our knowledge of hatred that would make us feel we are onto some way of dealing with it any better than we have until now ? perhaps it is an unfair or an unanswerable question and not the purpose of any film to do , but after seeing so much ugliness on screen , using gang violence , race baiting attitudes , and the polarization of the races to make its point about the current social crisis , it makes one wonder what is the method to unlearning the hatred learned , especially when all the great religious leaders and artists and philosophers could only reach those who were convinced already that hatred was wrong and couldn't change the world into an harmonious place , even if their message was an eloquent and a correct one . i expect this film will actually be relished for its provocative stance and its real sense of hatred it was able to duplicate in those white or black punks committing the violence , with the extreme views of hatred outweighing any other message the film was trying to deliver . and that is the beauty of the film ; the real lesson it puts on the table , the one that must be confronted ; it is what makes this film invaluable and genuine , a documentary-style look at racism . in britisher tony kaye's debut feature , after a successful career in doing tv commercials , he brings some of the attention getting scenes that commercials use to reach the consumer and has come up with a riveting film that paints a necessary ugly racial picture in bold black-and-white photography during some of its more graphically violent scenes . but the director was not satisfied with the finished product , claiming that the film's star , edward norton , re-edited the final version giving himself more screentime and that the studio themselves changed the film so that it could be more acceptable to a greater audience . the film did have an incomplete look to it and its ending did seem to be missing something , as there appeared to be holes in the story and the film ended too abruptly to make sense . nevertheless , the director did a good job , this is a provocative film and it is one that is grounded in reality and will be remembered for its powerful images of hatred . this was the hardest part of the film to swallow whole , especially when the change comes about so rapidly and the film did not do a good enough job storywise of showing how this change could be internally possible . what excelled though , was the acting , especially by norton , who understood his role and got the most out of it . this part of the story was too incredulous and sketchy for it to be anything but a well-intentioned but misguided effort at making everything turn out to be pat . dr . sweeney was also too sketchy a characterization for the film to feel fluid . he seemed to be placed there to provide the film with a safe way out of its difficult dilemma it dug for itself regarding the extremity of race relations . but it was just that extremity and its rawness that gave the film the kind of edge to it that made it potent . she is solid . in her small part- it's too bad she wasn't given more to say , she outshines the arguments against hatred presented by her weak mother , the ineffective murray , and the too good to be real principal . the most obvious flaw of the film , is that derek's ultra right-wing arguments against liberals and how the blacks are ruining the country , never get answered back in a satisfactory way . there is no one to speak up for what most people in america think is fair . and so when the tragic ending to the film takes place , what is there to say ! we have seen the worst about america , how herd-like certain people can behave and how the prison and the venice beach that is depicted both lump people into groups because of race . but if this is the current reality , then there are certainly alternative realities , where different human beings can live together in peace , which the film tried to show through dr . sweeney's presence , but that didn't work because his actions seemed too contrived . it is too bad that derek couldn't see how rotten his ideas were in time , maybe his intelligence wasn't all that it was cracked up to be . he didn't seem like he was a criminal or the typical dumb skinhead type , but he seemed as if he was someone who got confused over his bad ideas and didn't know what else to do . in my opinion , the film didn't really capture the mindset of the neo-nazi wholly , it just peeked in on them and was starting to zero in on their psyche and why they become skinheads and what makes them exit from being one , but it ended up by just lumping them together with all the other sterotyped groups and failed to go far enough in showing us what makes them , in particular , tick . there just seemed to be too much ground this film was trying to cover and it just couldn't adequately cover the entire history of contemporary racism without turning the film into a documentary . but this is still a quality film , that is both visually powerful and disturbing , showing how much dirt there is to bring up about america's ever-present racial problems . i just wish the film didn't give us an entire year's history curriculum about racism in two hours . if it didn't back off from its characterization of derek and danny , and if it kept hitting the sore points in society that ordinary people find hard to talk about without getting overwrought or emotionally racial about , we might have had a great film . the potential for this good film to be much better than it was , was certainly there for the taking . i guess all we can do is wait for his next film and see what he does with that one before we can fully accept his argument for what went wrong here , but let me praise him and the fine supporting cast for what was right about the film , which was most of the film . 
raising arizona ( director/writer : joel coen ; screenwriter : ethan coen ; cinematographer : barry sonnenfeld ; cast : nicolas cage ( h . a very funny spoof about a colorful couple who must have a child and will try to get one by any means possible . through the use of a voiceover , emanating from h . i . as the narrator , the logical sequence of the story is followed . the film has its moments of serious pauses , as h . i . there are a few more complications along the way , as h . i . here the comedy was predictable chevy chase sort of material . the coen brothers know how to make a quirky film and they sure know how to write side-splitting dialogue . and if you are looking for something heavier , like a lesson to be gotten from all this or a searing comment on society , maybe you could even find that here also . though sometimes the comic situations and the way all the characters talk funny , seem forced , it still recovers from these lapses and bounces back with more off-the-wall situations once reserved for " keystone cop " comedies , like ferocious dogs chasing the hero , improbable victories for our improbable hero while fighting goliaths , and store clerks who have hidden vengeance inside them . if it is absurd comedy that makes you do cartwheels , something that is unique and dark enough to have some bite in it , then this film is funny enough to overcome some of its failing moments . 
this directorial debut for kitano ( hana-bi/sonatine ) is a visual stunner in unmitigated violence . the " violent cop " is as violent and gratuitously violent of an entertaining film as i have ever seen . but even as the chief lectures him that he is too wild , he has to admit that he is effective in getting the job done . it's an action flick that questions one's sensibilities and has enough original twists in the story to keep you guessing how many of the cops are corrupt and what method will be used to kill off the yakuza members . there was something very likable about kitano's monster cop that might be hard to rationalize , but it does draw him close to the audience in a surprising way . if you like your violence with a dose of some intelligent dramatics thrown in for good measure , you should find this flawlessly well-paced film satisfying to some degree . but you better have a strong stomach for violence and how ridiculous this story is , built around titillating the audience with an abnormal display of graphic violence . 
it is always fascinating when a great foreign director takes a look at his own country in a way that outsiders can't really see it . he seems to have their best interest at heart and he cures them of their ills , and they know this , but the ones in charge don't seem to care and treat him as if he were a quack . i have not read the book to confirm this but this is what the director said in an interview that was reported by a film 'zine . what struck me as rather odd for the moment , until i thought further about it , was the film's opening , as the first words spoken are english that come from american bomber pilots flying over okayama , an island village next to the doctor's hometown of hibi , with a pow camp and a factory . this seems to indicate the influence america and its film industry has had on this quintessential japanese director and the need he has to show that the world is not necessarily a homogenous place , that all nations are influenced by each other . it is a rather odd philosophical opinion for one to have , especially for one who was himself getting bombed during the war ( imamura was a teen at the time of the war ) . no one in this film will get exactly what they want . this is a chaotic story that covers more topics than you could shake a stick at . this imamura film is not by any means his definitive one , but it shows enough of his lifetime concerns to be an interesting one for him to make his swan song in . what it suffers from is that the combination of comedy and serious drama have too many awkward and slow moments , that show many reactions to what the director visibly feels and makes them look as if they were predictably put into the cluttered story and don't have a breath of their own . to see how great a director he is , is to contrast those tepid scenes with some of the scenes that have his magical hand in it and see how simple and moving they were . there is no moral judgment that this is an american bomb , as it seems the philosophy here is , that when you live by the sword you must expect to die that way . the better choice for his country would have been one of practising a more loving nature , something that seems obvious , but what is also obvious is that the world has not learned that simple lesson and continues to rely on military might to fight its battles . in one conversation between akagi and sonoko , the beauty of their characters is magnified , as the deadly bacteria is viewed under the microscope and sonoko on seeing it , exclaims how beautiful it is : sonoko : " are there men and women bacteria ? " akagi : " neither male nor female , just perpetual reproductive motion . " " that doesn't exist in nature . more fun . " this film might not be a masterpiece ( which i don't think it is ) but it is clearly a film by a great man , a man who sees the contradictions in life in an amusing and contentiously cynical way , someone who can put the virtuous doctor in the same boat with the whore , and not be bothered by any moral judgments about who the better person is , because to him they are both beautiful . a strange farcical comedy results , that is often brilliant and at other times too messy to follow in all the cloudy trails it leads to . 
the relevance and devastating emotions of the slaves were intelligently presented ; even though , at times , the film was static and seemed to have no legs to get it going in the direction it wanted to be going . yet it still turned out to be a potent and forceful movie . it is hard to be critical of the stand for morality and piety the film makes ; but what saved this picture from being the " holier than thou self-righteous bomb " i thought it might have been , were the presence of john quincy adams ( hopkins ) and cinque in the film . without their human emotions , one by his words , the other by his facial expressions , the film would not have been as impactful as it was . there could be only so much that one can take from watching the misery of others , until it would become overbearing and defeat all its good intentions . or else , the film would have been a very difficult one to watch . spielberg is the master of a visual story , and here he is in top form . the carnage and cruelty aboard the slave ship are shockingly and revealingly shot , giving one enough of an idea what the slave had to endure . that gives the film the force and importance that is needed for it to make its moral point . 
talented mr . " the talented mr . ripley " offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel , the first being rene clement's " purple noon ( 59 ) , " a more straight- forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldn't do much with . anthony minghella ( the english patient ) will make the theme of the film into an identity crises problem that ripley has and allow the film to become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say about himself , " i always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody . " he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person , the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take . minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late 1950s live as ugly americans in europe , as the photography is brilliant , with its array of luminous colors , from mediterranean places such as san remo , palermo , roma , and venice . the beautiful scenery , villas , luxurious hotels , and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smart-set travel and spend their leisure time . this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film . but the story , as engrossing as it is , can so easily be forgotten when the film ends . this is a big budget miramax film , not an arthouse personal film . its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in . the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot , which are enough to sink a ship . she just seems to be along for the ride- her part is a rather inconsequential one , though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in , but here we are , at least , spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks . we just see her justifiable petulant anger , as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval , indicating i know what you did to my dickie . ripley's main intent , will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that jude does a good job of conveying , as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side . the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wide-open and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence . hoffman's screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen . when he wasn't onscreen , the story wasn't quite as fascinating , which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was . and , even if , there seems to be little sympathy for the idle-rich during ripley's spree , there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley , who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with . thereby , the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance , who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guilt-ridden nature . in the novel , ripley is more of a long-range scheming sociopath than he is in the film . the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story , and makes it more creepy but not more endearing . i think the reason for that , is because the matt damon part loses the character's rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer . to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripley's narcissistic eyes , and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated . the problem with that , is it simplified all the dark notions of ripley's character and lightened the burden of the story too much , trying to make it conform with the '90s style of film . as a result , this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story . the film became less meaningful the longer it went on , and it ran for 139- minutes . 
this is a man's film , for the kind of a man who is lost in his sense of being a man and lost in the nostalgia of the '70s drug scene . the women all have minor parts and are viewed as sex objects or conniving harlots . so you see the direction this film is going , it is cartoonish in characterization , with ridiculous dialogue , plenty of zany characters , and no discernible plot . stars make cameo appearances and do their shticks , even if it adds nothing to the plot . the john turturro one , where he plays the flaming mexican queen , is particularly funny . but since " the dude " is just being set-up , it really doesn't matter that he is not qualified for the job , even if he does take this job to be a serious one , and his dim observations of things are humorously abetted by his friends even dimmer observation of things , which makes things really seem absurd . the comedy here is sometimes so sharp , that you could roll in the aisle with laughter and not seem any odder than the characters you see onscreen . the john goodman character , of the hot-tempered , ex-soldier , and adage prone advisor to " the dude , " is hysterically funny . everything about john goodman's character will apply to his tour of duty there , whether or not it is relevant to the situation . it is not as good a film overall as fargo , but it is funny enough to be a minor work in the coen brothers continuing attack on our sitcom culture . it also added a nice touch by having sam eliott , with his rich melodic voice , garbed as a cowboy , do the voice-over , adding touches of inane wisdom ; such as , his saying in mock seriousness , " sometimes you get the bear , sometimes the bear gets you . " this only adds more absurdity , to a story that was already bizarre to begin with . 
what is unconventional about this film is obviously not the plot , we have seen all this before , but the dialogue that is deliciously witty and outrageous , every character in the film has something to say that flies in the face of convention . these are people i wouldn't want to spend quality time with . i certainly would not want to be exchanging barbs with them . but i do find them charming on the screen , as i am able to ignore how inane the dialogue really is and how threadbare the story is , all because there was too much to like about this film to be over critical of it ( i liked tarantino's homage to grier and the '70s , as he plays some delphonics soundtracks and introduces pam's appearance in the film with a '70s soundtrack of bobby womack singing " across 110th street " ) . this is a film about characters not story line . bridget fonda plays the part of the sex-pot , druggie girlfriend of jackson , who possesses a twisted sense of humor that doesn't sit too well with robert de niro . this is a very quiet role for an actor of his stature , but he performs it as he should , on a low level , not upstaging the loquacious jackson . the scene is brilliantly funny , as tucker tells jackson why he doesn't want to get in the trunk . it is funny even after we see and realize the violence that follows because we don't care what happens to most of the characters in this film , not even to the rather sweet pam , though we are somewhat affected by her desperate situation for a moment or two . he steals the picture in a low-key , enigmatic performance . he might be the only one in the film we could care about , and the only one we wonder about , but , even for him , we do not feel deeply emotional . after a while the jackson character becomes too much for us to handle and actually starts wearing on our nerves . the film pulls off its goal to be entertaining , but falls way short of being as entertaining a film as pulp fiction . what is noteworthy about the film is how crisp the acting was . i , especially , liked the way pam played her part . it was very believable and without believing her the picture would have fallen apart . but , overall , the story lacked the kind of depth needed for it to be anything but a rather well-made and entertaining film . 
this is an updated fable of the teutonic lovers , tristan and isolde . it is now considered to be a film classic , outliving the initial rejection of it . i did not feel that there was real passion on screen between the lovers , though i could accept their love intellectually and could understand that their fate was to die next to each other . . . the film satisfied my aesthetic senses . i thought it had magical qualities and enough of a brooding atmosphere to make up for my inability to be won over by sologne's performance . she was the weak link in this otherwise forceful film . 
of all things made into a film , calligraphy is one subject that few movies have used as their subject , but greenaway , true to his reputation as a filmmaker with an outrageous streak in him to live up to , continues to make outlandish films that have a certain perversity to them , as well as show an elegance in clever filmmaking . pillow book is an individual's diary of observations and a presentment of an interesting list of things the diarist has jotted down , such as duck eggs and a silver bowl filled with shaved ice . the plot turns surprising simple , as revenge becomes the motive for nagiko , and this offbeat film will remain interesting mostly through its striking visualizations . the stunning visualizations range from ones of comedy to ones of sensuality to ones of gross cruely . her sensuality is seen in most of the books she writes , but seems special when she is with jerome , as frontal nudity is there , to be examined from all different angles by a technically efficient camera , that handles these nude scenes as casually as if the actors were fully dressed . the fun in the film is in the silliness of the story's subject matter as juxtaposed against the solemnity of the books being written on skin , with either somber religious chants or the same pop tune being played over and over in the background . she is really the only one in the film that we see developing and the only one whom we come to understand what she is trying to do . there seems to be a determined effort to be witty , even if the humor is not scaled to what the story is saying . the result of this work is a film that is startling to behold , with gorgeous photogenic shots , superimpositions , amazing computer graphics , a splash of intriguing gold and red color patterns , with everything ending up so perverse and lost in an intimacy that seems so melodramatic that even the scenes that do mean something to the characters still seem to be too absurd to really mean much . but the film did have plenty of fire to it , hatred , passion , jealousy , and mystery . i just didn't find that the story was that emotionally engaging to win me over completely to what i was seeing , even if i found the film had much to show for its effort . but for those who like to see the unusual and something that is artistic , this film is both unique and unforgettable : it's pure greenaway . 
harry cohn , head of columbia pictures , gave joseph h . lewis his first break to make a classier picture than his previous low-budget ones , and when he saw the early rushes of the film , he elevated " my name is julia ross , " from a 10-day " b " to an 18-day " a " picture . though not original in motif , nevertheless this film is a beauty , one that is able through its visualizations to strike a fresh looking chord . it is noted for its brooding atmosphere , its classical noir camera work , as the heroine is seen forlornly looking out of windows with bars on them , and the film is particularly noteworthy for the fine performances of its stars , nina foch as julia ross , dame may whitty as mrs . hughes , and george macready as ralph hughes . ralph is a rather frightening character , often seen whittling intensely away with his knife . lewis comes up with a few interesting plot twists to make the story even more scary , as the trapped julia fights desperately to save her life , figuring her best chance , is to get word to dennis . the result is a pretty good suspense story and the beginning of lewis's illustrious career in directing a better type of a film . 
a very pleasing rendition of a woody allen film , directed and written by woody . it is a fictional docudrama that smacks of woody's playfulness and love for jazz , and his inability to tell a straight story , but his great ability to tell a very personal one , which in this case is a very suitable way of telling it . the film also has the good sense to reach for woody's unique wit to get it through a few dry spells in the story . the joke that made me laugh the loudest , was when sean was bawling the girls out whom he pimped for about not bringing back enough money for him that night and they tell him , what do you expect , it's a jewish holiday ! it was the timing and the facial expressions seen on sean penn that made those kind of jokes work . the music was just beautiful to listen to and was played often enough during the course of the film , which should be pleasing to the aficionados of jazz . the film relies on the quirkiness of penn's performance to tell its lighthearted tale in a mock tone of seriousness , which captures the flavor of that period . her pantomine acting was in the best tradition of silent movies , as through her expressive facial gestures all the emotions she was feeling at the time were clearly seen ; all the long- sufferings that she has gone through . she also has a most pleasing smile , that anyone could understand . all the stories are so far apart , that none of the ridiculous versions could be verified by any of the experts , but what all the stories have in common , is that he hid in the backseat of the gangster's car and heard for sure that they were having an affair . woody's film is an appealing look back at that age of swing music and maybe a composite glimpse of how some jazzmen lived their lives . the great music played incudes the following renditions : " sweet sue , " " all of me , " " i'm forever blowing bubbles " and " i'll see you in my dreams . " 
written and directed by peter wellington , " joe's so mean to josephine " comes armed with a sharp-edged script and two bravo performances . this indie film , by the first-time director , takes place in toronto . it is not an easy movie to like because the relationship between the two opposites is painstakingly brutal and progresses at a very slow speed , building to both their metamorphoses and an inevitable but not fulfilling conclusion . but there is a power in the raw dramatics unearthed due to the edgy performances , at first told from the woman's point but later shifting to the man's view , that makes this one worth sticking with . there's something to this character study that breaks through what seem like an ordinary story and gives this film a puzzling breath of fresh air . it has something to say about relationships , and it says it in a way contemporaries can relate to . the director won canada's claude jutra award . he also is emotionally unstable , exhibiting fits of violence . she thinks it would be a good idea for him to try reading some of those books . but by this time something is also happening to joe . his usual reaction of violence to such situations won't work here . he pathetically tells her , in-between fits of throwing objects around the house , " that i was wishing it was like it was before-- when you wanted to be with me . " he is almost begging her , while sitting like a baby on the floor , " why can't i be your boyfriend ? " there's a lot this movie has to say about meeting the wrong person , and this character-driven work makes the most of it , in this very engrossing , humorous , incisive , but , at times , very upsetting film to watch . 
wallace shawn and andre gregory play themselves , in louis malle's two-character drama , displaying wit , humor and charm . what is real is their personalities that shine through , as for the opinions stated by each , that is scripted but is probably not that far from their actual personalities . what results is a dinner conversation that at times seems bewitching and at other times seems to be egotistical twaddle . the overall effect is that the film seemed different , and therefore one had the odd quality of watching these two eat roast quail in a top-scale restaurant and psychoanalyze each other between munching on their potato soup . it proved to be a compelling venture in storytelling , if nothing else . some people in the theater thought he cracked-up and some have even seen him talking to trees . andre had just come from ingmar bergman's " autumn sonata , " and was moved by ingrid bergman saying : " i could always live in my art , but not in my life . '' as the two engage in a genial disagreement about what life means , but showing most of all , that they are both good listeners , challenging the audience to carefully listen to a movie more than to watch it . wally tells of playing a cat on stage and how some of the other actors who actually liked him , made negative remarks of how he won't be able to perform properly in that costume . wally believes they said this because it is difficult to express feelings directly to people . andre counters , that we can't be direct so we end up saying the weirdest things . in tibet , he watched as tibetans would have tea in silence , sitting for hours and finding no need to talk if they had nothing to say . we don't have to travel to some exotic place to find reality , it is right here . he also goes on to say , that if you can't react honestly to people-there is a deadness . the dinner seemed to end on an apology for both to go back to their comfortable lifestyles , momentarily exhilarated by the richness of the meal , the cheer of communicating their thoughts , and by the many provoking subjects broached . these two seemed like two smug but likable new york intellectuals , who have a good rap going for them . i thought how riveting the conversation was and how it all ended up being so mundane , titillating but irrelevant . the only thing left savoring was the delicious mood they set . but for the viewer , any one of the numerous topics brought into the conversation , could be a stimulant for further contemplation . i thought the energy and the absurdity of the film , was the intangible grandeur , the something that made this film a special treat , no matter its seemingly bourgeois idealism . 
the film highlights the interactions of the likable but weakminded lukas and the vibrant emmy ( sophie rois ) to tell its sad tale . it is a dark morality tale , excitingly shot , about the powerful ones acting petty and cruel , while the peasants act with dignity and courage . ruzowitzky's film throws out many political ideas , gives one a true sense of what collective hatred and what class warfare are like . the film has many different moods to it : ranging from dark comedy to free-spirited romance to bitter violence . it is a well-made film ; it clearly shows how injustice is part of a system that enslaves people . 
this , his first film since his 1994's death and the maiden , is a visually stunning mystery chiller about the supernatural that is a good example of old-fashioned storytelling . a lengthy film ( 132 minutes ) that doesn't overstay its welcome , as it keeps one guessing till the very end how it will be resolved and even then , there is puzzlement . but the film is not without some flaws in its storytelling as attested by the last scenes , which are resolved in pyrotechnics and do leave a lot to be desired . many critics will justifiably argue that there is no proper payoff in the director's payoff . but i'll take this polanski version of a horror story over so many others that i have seen recently , there is an elegant craftsmanship and an ability shown by him , to keep one in suspense for most of the film without resorting to hollywood's special effect grab bag of tricks typically used for this genre . polansky also captured the feel of what it is like to be a rare-book collector . it is a film that , if it does nothing else , it depicts the lives of those who are searching for dramatic meaning in their life through books of the occult . that polanski is a skeptic , only adds resonance to the telling of the story . he does not make a copy of the book and therefore places himself in an awkward spot if the book should be stolen . his unique lifestyle is one that is rarely depicted in movies as well as it is here . she is the most enigmatic character in the story , whose real identity will be revealed by the end of the film . she did have one nude scene in the movie , which she passed with flying colors . there are more things to like about this film than dislike . for starters , i was impressed by depp's subdued performance , it gave his character credibility and even though he wasn't an ethical character , he made himself more palatable as the film progressed and he seemed to become more of a victim than someone who is uncaringly in this deal for just a windfall profit . he had a healthy detachment from the subject matter of the book ( just like the director was detached from the storyline ) , as he unwittingly uncovers various reasons people like to collect occult books . i was also impressed by the way darius khondji's cinematography took me around europe , into castles , private library collections , voyeuristically looking into dark corners , and into a devil worship ceremony . it was shot largely by using a wide-angled lens , always pointing to interesting shots of dark corridors , or of villages that had a strangely beautiful feel toward them . i felt i was transported into the world of book collectors , hearing them converse and seeing what makes them want to be collectors , and how some are merely pretenders and some real lovers of books . the film , unfortunately , ultimately suffered from an undue silliness and how it ended by fading out to a glowing white screen , as if that is supposed to mean something special , did not work for me . unless , it is meant solely as polansky's private joke that all this devil worship is nonsense in the first place , and by ending on a blank note , all he is doing is telling the audience that there is nothing to see . if there's a more metaphysical message , it wasn't conveyed to me by the film . but , that aside , i still maintain that this picaresque film adapted from arturo perez-reverte's popular spanish novel el club dumas is better than most satanic thrillers , especially those recent ones relying on blood and gore to shock the viewer . here , the director is mostly spoofing the conventions of horror movies and it is his very personal humor that should be appreciated , along with the brilliance he brings to the screen with his filmmaking ability . the satan worshippers' annual meeting on torchia's birthday is a good example of what i mean by the director's brand of malevolent humor being on display , seeing how the wannabes in satanism are cloaked in black and using mumbo jumbo to summon up satan , as langella boldly enters their ceremony and calls them all fools and shouts , " boo ! " that is the joke polansky is having with the audience . both these ritualized ceremonies should not be looked at without seeing them for the farces they are in the eyes of each filmmaker . polansky has crafted a metaphysical suspense film that is more lightheaded than scary , which might disappoint some but should not take away from the many pleasures derived from this engrossing thriller . 
a more-than-acceptable variation of jacques tourneur's cat people ( 42 ) , that is excellent in spots , but lags in its overall pacing . the scene is marvelously done , as it cuts away from the leopard's attack to picture leonora enjoying this revenge . though very imitative of the tourneur film and not quite as masterfully done , this rarely shown horror film is worth catching for its dark intensity and the eerie mood it sets . 
refn moves the pusher along with an inward existential beat to it and outwardly we hear the loud pulsating electric music of heavy-metal . the film has a sharp-edged look by using available light- shot so that the handheld camera jitters- just like the unflappable antihero does in his guts . there are some chilling scenes thrown in , that are not shocking , but represent the matter-of-fact violence that is taking place . whether frank lives or not , becomes less important than in seeing what a hell he has made for himself , desperately trying anything he can , to outhustle his way out of this mess he is in . the only thing that stops this film from being better than it is , is that frank has proven himself to be a worthless human being , and the film doesn't take us into his inner being , giving him any hope if he should somehow survive the mess he's in , he would be a better person for it . so , ultimately , it is difficult to care that much about what happens to frank . the director has cooked up a very disturbing film , that is derivative of pulp fiction ( the conversation frank and tonny have over the difference between renting a video and going out to a movie could be right out of pulp ) . but , this is not a bad effort for someone who never went to film school . 
the wilderness and the snowbound land are visually appealing , while the eskimos come across as a friendly people , easily given to smiling , even if some are suspicious of the white men , thinking of them to be useless as hunters . the filmmaker massot shows the filmmaker flaherty staging shots of eskimos building igloos , sleeping together , and lots of faked shots of eskimos doing things solely for the camera . but somehow the film works in a very human way and the thrill of seeing the eskimos live in such harsh conditions is something few westerners can readily comprehend or for that matter , have ever seen before . both films are distinguished for using the real intuits to play themselves . so much for hollywood and what it considers important . 
this way no one talks if captured . one of the most absurd scenes , even for fuller , who lives to film whacky scenes like this one , is in the teahouse , where the american gangsters are partaking of the traditional japanese tea ceremony and griff is carrying on to the ice-cold sandy about not being close to him anymore , ranting at him , i'm your ichi-ban , not that newcomer . why can't i go with you on the next job ? this is a particularly violent and crude noir work , whose subject matter offers a penetrating look at the american occupation of japan , basically saying that what the u . s . is doing there is criminal . it also magnifies the huge cultural bridges the two countries have and why it is so difficult for the two countrys to get to know and trust one another . this is highlighted by the very formal structure of the love relationship between mariko and eddie , where eddie is always viewed as a foreigner and can't be fully accepted , no matter what he does . their love story left an empty feeling in the pit of my stomach , as there seemed to be a psychological separation between the two that couldn't be reconciled . even though the story had a lot of loose ends to it and didn't make sense most of the time , the strangeness of the characters and the oddness of the location made for a telling tale , a sure-fire iconoclastic fuller experience , for a director who just goes into a film and grabs what he wants out of it , not caring a darn about how silly it all looks . fuller , as always , is resourceful and fresh . his films guarantee the viewer a jolt or two of electricty into their nonplused movie faces . here , the number of jolts is much higher , thereby making this an even juicier fuller spectacle . 
holy smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters , to kate winslet's psychodelic-like india sojourn , and then onto her trying experiences in the naturally scenic australian outback . the film has perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals , and a divertingly amusing storyline to tune into , even if it gives into its own silly side and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into its own cynical view of life , resorting to a politically safe response to all its pin pricks about mind control . though , in all honesty , it should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in this refreshingly different style . how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue . there is too much of a loss of subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the themes it broaches . but it does , on the serious side of its agenda , at least , raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat women . it is scripted by the campion sisters ( jane & anna ) and directed by jane , with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of lustiness . at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony . but mom has trouble adjusting to india : its crowds , lack of modern toilets , and its strange culture . all of their warmth and smiles for her seem disingenuous , especially when compared to the guru's . he also goes heavy on the mouth spray , making sure he is sweet-smelling at all times . the two go off to the outback as p . j . puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking . the film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a battle of the sexes , with the inevitable male-female struggle taking precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into the story . in reality , praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be answered . so , in short , he's not for her , and no matter what he does won't work , which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy . what does this all mean , not too much , except its fun to see keitel get his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as kate turns the tables on him . but , ah ! those breasts of kate are really something to behold . . . but it is her personality that is the star of the film . she was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow caricature , and her performance was daring , even smashing , taking this zany script and making the most of it , getting out of it certainly more than it deserved . which means the film actually worked in some skewed sense , as it dove into the question of mind control and the human condition and gave no answers , except the strong suggestion that having compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma . and , in a muddled way , this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it come to its own conclusions , which is why i imagine this film will get a mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it , to those who rave about it . there were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot film , that shot itself unecessarily in the foot , even though it did manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop assault on the senses of propriety , making this a madcap comedy instead of anything else . it also badly underutilized the talented pam grier , giving her such a miniscule and predictable part , that she had no chance to do her thing . but what it had going for it , is a sense of freedom , an eye for beauty , and kate's undaunting performance , which makes it something to put in your pipe and smoke . if only it wasn't so ridiculous , it could have been a much more salient film , even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way . 
for ms . deepa mehta -- fire is the first film of her trilogy on the elements , this her second , and water , to be filmed later , will be her third . they believe they can be invisible , spreading sweetness to the land like sugar placed in the middle of a glass of milk . the problem with the film is twofold ; one , is that all these tragic events are translated through the childish eyes of lenny , who cannot grasp everything that is happening , she just doesn't have the maturity to do that . because of that , the story has too much of a childish flavor to it and is simplified to a point that touches on being too fine . it was an unneeded artifice , that tended to spoil the flow of the film's dramatics . the other problem , with this otherwise splendid history lesson and tragic love story , is that all the movie's metaphors are used as if they were merely to amplify the historical tale . the character's lives were reduced in scope and they seemed to be milked for the benefit of making the story fit into the historical text . it is stunningly photographed , using reds and purples to express the blood-curdling scenes of lahore under siege and a glowing yellow for the warm household scenes and a brownish amber to catch the vast beauty of the countryside . it is noteworthy for exploring in detail the destruction of innocence and the arbitrary splitting up of the earth , and how everyone gets caught up in the emotional frenzy of hatred and how difficult it is to just do what is right . there was a certain power the film had , that could not be denied . nandita das as shanta , is the heart of the picture . her performance was very moving and gave life to this epic film . his masterful performance , changing from an endearing and helpful figure , to one who embraces violence , was what put a human face of evil on this melodrama and saved the film from being thought of as mostly a metaphorical historical exercise . 
a powerfully haunting film , that should leave one with some deep emotional pains over its human drama or turn one completely off by its obvious political intentions . this is a banned film in china and one that they will be unlikely to be showing there for quite awhile , as its negative reactions to mao's cultural revolution from 1967-1976 , is a blanket indictment against china's attempt at mass indoctrination . for him , one place is like another , so it makes no difference that he is in so barren a region . it is sheer madness the way this program is administered and carried out , whereas no one comes for her when her time is up and there is no one there to tell her anything . that she panics , thinking she will be left here for good , is understandable . the film shows by comparing her mood swings to the natural surroundings , the vast and changing sky , how small she feels , how it has sunk into her how far apart she is from the things she loves to do and how much she misses her warm family . by contrast , it is shown how comfortable lao jin is here . it is a most interesting performance by this 16-year-old actress , lu lu , which gets the audience feeling sorry for her , but at the same time , feeling annoyed that she acts so badly against the saintly herder . it is a uniquely masterful performance , that seldom gets translated on the screen in such a true way as it does here . the flaw in the film , comes with its bleak ending , that seemed to be contrived and used as a means of getting more sympathy out of the audience than it needed to . it took away from the impact of this strange relationship , that had been mesmerizing and touching in a very real way . it returned the film to the heavy-handed symbolic message it had succeeded in avoiding through the telling of its energetic human drama . the beautiful camera shots of the landscape and the poetry of the girl's loss of innocence , were undermined to a certain degree by how this allegory unfolded . xiu xiu's story is sad one , but one wonders if it was really so overwhelming as it is portrayed here . nevertheless , this was a substantial film , that had its heart in the right place and offers a story that is of a superior quality . overall , a splendid effort is achieved . 
the heroine in this wacky autobiography learns the hard way that it pays to be unique , even if that might require an acceptance of her being unhappy , if the alternative is , that happiness means that you have to be like everyone else . " slums " is a sharp-witted , biting screwball comedy about a semi-dysfunctional family who have some problems that prevents them from being a happy family but not the kind of problems that can't be overcome . her wide-eyed and aghast looks at what she sees happening to her are what give this film its particular flavor and her comical and sad observations are right-on-target . murray is a brash , intrusive , and insensitive single-parent , who means well but overextends his good intentions and fails to see his mistakes in time . tomei gives a wonderfully over-the-top performance as a lost soul , who brings her quirky antics into a household that is trying to act like " people " but can't seem to make it . this scene was funny but it was also very hurtful to watch . it touched on all the nerves that made this into an intense dramatic scene , that worked so well because the script was tight and the actors were well-cast , with especially natasha lyonne , as the girl who was always being surprised as she tries to find out who she is . a small gem of a film , much better than the sitcom material it portends to be . 
this film was adapted from a lucille fletcher 22-minute radio drama , where agnes moorehead played the invalid heiress leona stevenson . the film plays on one's fears of being alone and of being physically handicapped . the film uses the method of flashback to enlarge the story . the film is well executed , mainly through the efforts of the director and the star of the film . even as an intolerable woman , casting herself in self-imprisonment , she engineers our sympathy for her current plight , as we see that she desperately needs psychological treatment more than anything else . 
here , the director , himself a rom member , is in love with the gypsies -- their foibles and all -- and plays a joke with their worldwide pejorative image by reversing the things usually said about gypsies , and having the gypsies say them about the foreigners . the film has caught the gypsy mood and their persona : the gypsies here have gold teeth , the women bathe together in the nude and talk about the men in a frank sexual manner , the men drink a lot , play music with deep feelings , curse on a regular basis , and are quick to smile and see the humor in almost everything they do . may i rot ! " they shout in excitement , " there's a great big gadjo sleeping at our place ! " " gadjo dilo , " in the gypsies' romany language , means " crazy stranger , " which becomes a reference to the french youth and the film's title . for the director , the question becomes , how is it , whenever events turn bad , the gypsy community is almost always made the scapegoat . gatlif succeeded in setting an evocative gypsy mood , touching on their charms , highlighting their moving music , demonstrating the sheer joy in their wedding ceremonies , and leaving a good taste in one's mouth about the gypsy spirit to survive . though the film doesn't tell a great story but a conventional one , even with all the exotic atmosphere the film exudes in , but it still holds one's interest throughout , as the moods change and gypsy life takes a more dramatic turn . 
this creepy serial killer tale had all the more fright in it than the more highly touted " felicia's journey , " and was a superior telling of a homicidal maniac on the prowl story than the more flamboyant venture " american psycho " was . i take the natural momentum of a person and draw it towards me . you don't always choose what you do , sometimes what you do chooses you . " hampton fancher , the blade runner screenwriter and the first-time director of " the minus man , " creates a film that sets a dark mood of everyday normal life contrasted by the cheery personality of vann , who looks like the average " joe , " easily fitting into his surroundings . he is such a well-mannered and congenial young man , whose appeal is supposed to make us irritated that we can like someone like him . the emptiness of his action , and the film's emphasis on his charms , while keeping his past mysterious , adds chills to his moody persona . but , because he is so polite , he does not arouse the trooper's suspicions and therefore no search of the vehicle takes place . this is a different kind of part for the usually gruff garofalo . what carries the day for this film about the banality of evil , which presents its story as a mind game owen wilson is playing , is the strong performances by him and brian cox , as they both are good at conveying men who are psychologically damaged goods . the film gets over , despite its weakness of allowing the serial killer to be someone whom we can never understand or come to terms with . these weird killings do happen in present society , and when we read about them in the newspapers , we even know less about 'why' than we do here . in the characterization wilson gave to this psychopath , you could see how his normalcy wasn't normal , and maybe that's about all we know about most serial killers . but , we can't let society off the hook as generously as we do in the newspapers , and what makes this film particularly engaging , at least more engaging than most of the serial killer films i have seen recently , is that in this film the sickness in society also becomes part of understanding why these weird things happen . what is unsaid becomes , at least , pointed out as to where we should start looking for answers , if we can only stop looking at the conventional places where we usually look and start looking at ourselves as a society and what we have created . i just wish this film had more body in it , more of a feeling for what it was up to , something more revealing . 
sacha vierny , as cinematographer , supplies the film with striking visuals , every scene is beautiful to behold . the technicolors of favor for the film are the different shades of brown resembling the marvelous architecture in rome and the pure shades of white , which tend to introduce the characters in their best light , before it becomes apparent that they are all obnoxious to a certain degree and not as pure as they first might have seemed . this film like all greenaway productions , is a splendid visual film to behold . the film might not add up to much in weight , but the sum of its parts were like an apple hitting newton on his noggin . it had one mesmorizing visual scene after another , and gave one enough fodder to think about all the spiritual and corporeal themes it just spread before your eyes without going further into them . greenaway , as always , is an acquired taste . 
the film makes it a point to show that the fictional region has its quota of local eccentrics , many of whom are related to one another . for the most part , the film is done in a campy way , balanced by veteran character actor ernie hudson playing his role seriously , taking offense at the racial slurs and showing that he's a powerful man , willing to take a strong stand for what he believes in . this is a very compelling story , aside from the weakness of claire's role , where she acts more campy than real . the film is most similar in racial tone to " to kill a mockingbird , " but is played more humorously and with less drive for its interracial sexual motives being the source for the crime . 
her mind has already been f * cked with . their conversations and snide remarks while carrying on the investigation brings on an element of comedy , which seems absurd in the face of how horrid the murder is , but it is diverting . this explanation of what she did , seems far-fetched and takes away a lot of credibility from the story , which had been thus far , a very ably put together murder mystery . the feminist role in the military and the male attitude toward women in the military is sharply touched upon . the film throws itself into the dark water and everyone gets splashed by its jump into water that is too deep for travolta . it works as an entertaining and well-acted thriller that could have used more imagination and less gruesome sexual details in telling its story , as the military cover-up might have been a more interesting direction to go than in dwelling on the sordid crime . 
this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play " hospitality suite . ''its these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . in this case , it is landing the big kahuna . what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch . these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see . 
inspired by the maverick finnish director aki kaurismaki's 1987 " hamlet goes business , " michael almereyda ( another girl , another planet/nadja ) directs this updated mainstream , mock serious version of hamlet with great wit , style , and immediacy . he effortlessly transfers locations from denmark to the new york city of 2000 , which shows how malleable hamlet is and how right it seems to take it away from its staginess and sole reliance on dialogue instead of making it a more cinematic experience . but what almereyda fails to do in this slenderized ( no gravediggers here ) version of hamlet , is make his modern visuals jive with the staginess of the bard's words , therefore the film always felt jarring . even in some very beautifully mannered scenes , there was a note of clumsiness , indicating something was missing or didn't match about this far-reaching production that bordered on mawkish giddiness , though not quite falling down that hole . the old style english dialogue and the new visuals did not make for a coherent film , with the visuals being spectacular and relevant , while the dialogue seemed to be from another planet , or from another venue . i thought i would never say that shakespeare's hamlet is better visually than its dialogue , but in this film version , that is clearly the case . by not changing the tone of the shakespearian dialogue to the neurotically nasal everyday speech of the modern new yorker , while radically altering the visual effects to fit in with the current times , the film developed a split-personality , which it was never able to recover from . if you are going to change things , why make half the film conform to traditional shakespeare , when you could have taken a further risk and made the entire film a glittering display of inventiveness , and perhaps achieve a major breakthrough in how to present hamlet to a modern audience ! hamlet is a troubled soul who is a struggling digital videomaker , with fits of self-importance and bouts of illusionary grandeur . hamlet has such a grungy attitude . the video is a comically haphazard avant-garde work by the animator lewis klahr , showing a variety of historical film footage . hamlet and ophelia are a perfectly beautiful looking but obnoxious couple , who are plagued by the modern problem of lack of communication . it is difficult to take this hamlet in quite the same serious way it is usually presented onstage , and that's just fine . refreshingly , this film does not have one ounce of pretention to high culture . the cast all come with their own individual ideas about the characters they are playing and offer their odd renditions for the traditional roles . hawke delivers his " to be or not to be " soliloquy in the action video section of a blockbuster store . the story , though almost cut in half , still is basically the same . but the dramatic effect is different . you have to lose something when you throw away all that shakespeare dialogue . in some scenes we look through all the egotism of the characters through glass that is crystal clear and easy to shatter , and the effect is a sharpened sense of what we are seeing . but when the final tragedy unfolds , there is no real emotion in it , the film failed to pull us into that scene . it seemed as if the soul had been taken out of it . and that is the major fault of the film . what lingers , is a strong sense that we are steeped in a hamlet who must be viewed with urgency , a sense of foreboding gloom , and with a sense of ticklish glibness . the picture was shot in super 16 millimeter . its nyc face is given a glossy , bluish and grayish tint , catching all the limos , glass closets , and glass high-rise structures john de borman could film with his superlative camerawork . nyc never looked more like a glistening denmark or a glass house , while " hamlet " looks more like a work of visual poetry instead of sounding like great literature . an interesting concept , too bad almereyda couldn't completely pull it off . yet i applaud the chances he took and all the misses never completely deterred me from enjoying the film . it came awfully close to being camp , but the oddness of this unlikely cast playing shakespeare , somehow , held the film together and made it accessible to an audience that shakespeare might not have reached before . even though hawke's hamlet had the edge of a young man's immaturity and impetuousness , what would have really given this film a sense of manic self-consciousness , would have been to cast sean penn as hamlet , though james dean in that part would have been the ultimate coup de grace .

the epsteins are wonderful musicians and storytellers , openly explaining their music and talking about themselves with no pretensions or false modesty . they have no inhibitions about talking , in fact , it is hard to get them to keep quiet . but the richness of the lively music and the very natural and easy way the brothers play and communicate , makes this a heartfelt film , just like the music being played . you don't have to be jewish to like the music , as they proved to be popular in front of a mainly non-jewish audience in berlin , who couldn't get enough of that music . but when they played in their florida neighborhood to an elderly jewish audience , you couldn't help but notice how much more lively and even more appreciative their audience was . it also goes on a dull side trip to pinsk , a place that borders russia-poland , where their parents are from , but someplace they are unfamiliar with and because of that there was nothing worthwhile to see there . but , in all fairness to the director , aside from a few lapses in the film , he did capture the essence of the kletzmer music and what makes the epsteins so special . the brothers take pride in their craft and it shows in their musical pieces presented , as they bring out a heartfelt joy in their music . it was a fun film to watch , and it was informative to watch them practice and discuss the music , never taking themselves too seriously , but always serious about doing a good job . this film should be seen for the remakable music , the film itself is not that remarkable . 
written and directed with style by richard shepard ( the linguini incident ) , " oxygen " is a compelling psychodrama , whose story is sickening but is superbly played by an excellent cast . adrien brody got the most he could get out of the character and gives a riveting performance of someone who has gone over the edge . maura tierney also turns in a spectacular performance , portraying a very troubled but courageous woman . it was clearer to find out what was troubling harry than it was to get to the bottom of her problem , but her characterization of a pained woman was almost as interesting as his . the victim's impatient husband pulls strings and gets thev f . b . i . no police procedure would ever take that chance , and the film hinges all its marbles on that being accepted for its tricky ending to work . but for sheer excitement , the fast-paced film moves rapidly along to see if the police can get to the buried frances in time , and in the meantime , brody gives the performance of his career so far . " oxygen " had some fresh air in its tank which it leaked out at times to refreshen some of its derivative scenes , especially the opening subway scene , where the lead police couple come across a wanted felon and give chase , in a scene that looked like it came right out of " the french connection . " 
a visually stunning serial killer film , with mind-bending special effects , computer imaging , special f/x , and gorgeous costumes , as directed by commercial and music-video director tarsem singh , in his debut feature film . the cinematic beauty and originality of this pioneering visual film hides the banality of the story and the weak storytelling , as the director doesn't know quite what to do with the film after setting it up with set designs that are simply breathtaking . he doesn't know how to close the story or how to keep it suspenseful . this is an arty serial killer film that is not necessarily an art nor is it a mainstream film , it's an in-betweener , where what is seen is more than what there is , which leaves a terrible void when trying to get past the colorful , disturbing , and enjoyable display of images , and then deciphering the content . but the visuals are so stimulating , that they almost cover up all the film's loose ends . the visuals inside the mind are spectacular images of lunacy and are laced with compelling and original art designs , all of the images are beautifully colored . in the child's head , she is dressed as a princess in a white feathered gown , standing on glistening island sand with a crystal clear sky invading the senses with an array of brightness , that could be as inviting as a tourist commercial for travellers , except there is a bizarre quality about these images that is more than an eyeful for an ad . most of the film , is spent taking a mind trip with catherine as she explores the subconscious of both this child and of a serial killer , while the chase of the killer is not particularly interesting , playing a secondary role to the cinematography of the mind . the main focus of the film is the visual journey itself , therefore the actors are mostly asked to blend in and not steal the scenery from the visuals . it is something they successfully do . jennifer lopez is surprisingly credible as a therapist and the one the film hinges on to take us on this mind trip , vince vaughn plays his low-key role in an expressively adequate manner , and vincent d'onofrio elicits some sympathy for being a victim of child abuse while also seen as an over-the-top psycho , someone who is capable of torturing women for no logical reasons . but one is always reminded that the actors are not as important as the cinematography is , as the film always returns to the visualizations of the mind to keep the intensity going . the film had enough visual material to keep you looking at it and wondering what does it all mean since it wasn't a very frightening serial killer picture , and its mind explorations did not take us down some unmarked jungian trail . it ends up by having the hero rescue the heroine in the nick of time , allowing the film to wend its way back into the conventional way serial killer films usually conclude . perhaps , with a more razor-sharp story and requiring more from the capable cast , the film could have lived up to its visualizations and have been a masterpiece , instead of settling for being an engrossing film that is very entertaining , a film that certainly sets a new high standard for photography . 
it could be almost like a documentary that someone like espn would do , such as there 'when baseball was a game , ' but in this depression-era nostalgia piece about a genuine jewish baseball superstar -- supposedly , the first one who openly said he was jewish and wouldn't change his name -- the game becomes much more than what it is . it becomes a look at the social and political climate of america just as much as a baseball biography . it would drive in . it was as if hank was passing the baton to jackie . there is no doubt about it , hank was an inspiration to many people who needed such a heroic figure . this film had a very skillful way of telling its story about a bygone era , doing it in an effortlessly grand style , with a tongue-in-cheek humor . besides , any film that has a clip of the marx brothers breaking up a symphony orchestra to make it seem like a baseball game , has a good idea of when to be humorous and when to point out the seriousness of the slurs hank had to go through . hank was a class act , never openly complaining about what he went through , just talking about it because that was the real way it was . the only fault of the film , was that the director became too close to his subject , and perhaps , overdramatized the effects of greenberg . the conclusion of ww11 also had a lot to do with the change of america's attitude , though it is doubtful if anti-semitism is through for good , as there are still other barriers in america that have to be broken down , such as having a jewish president . 
all the country's money was needed to rebuilt , as movies seemed a frivolous activity at the time . rossellini used poor film stock leftover from the fascists and filmed despite all the technical deficiencies he ran into , and came up with a gritty , authentic looking film for his grim story of survival and fight for freedom . this was a breakthrough film for the director , whose neorealism style , using a hollywood type of narrative and a documentary style approach to filming , caught the dire mood of the resistance movement and the ordinary people who fought the fascists . awards such as the new york film critics circle and best film in cannes in 1946 , came to this film . it awakened an international audience to the knowledge that italian cinema was well and roberto rossellini was a director to be reckoned with , along with de sica , who just filmed " shoe shine " in the neorealism style , also , to international acclaim . the film has an immediacy about it , but it also seemed overly melodramatic at times , relying so much on the premise , that by being as good as the germans , the italians , the slave-race , can prove that there was no need for the war since there is no such thing as a master race . that manfredi dies without talking after being tortured , makes his heroics larger than anyone else's , and proves that the italians are every bit as good as the germans . rossellini hoped to examine the italian soul and show that there were both good and bad people among them , while the german's have gone so far off the edge of sanity , that it is hard to find a good german because of their perverse beliefs . anna magnani gives the film credibility through her humanity , as her story is filled with her heartfelt yearnings . the other professional actor among all the nonprofessionals to standout , was the priest role as warmly played by aldo fabrizi , who elicited a call for sensibility and caring for people . though , the film does not seem as relevant as it was when first released and acclaimed as a masterpiece , having lost some of its purity , nevertheless , it still retains its moral high ground and its ability to show the collective will of the people , who resisted being oppressed . it is still a work of considerable merit . 
vincent gardenia and elliott gould who are in the film , were also in the original play . everything is played out in a revue format , as every sketch is done in the form of a scathing farce . the performers were outstanding , as i was especially pleased with marcia rodd's captivating portrayal of someone with spunk . the film was torridly on target and eerily funny , but only to a point , as it seemed to create such a far-out situation , that it was difficult to keep laughing when there was so much cynicism and so much that went beyond the pale of farce and became too arcane to decifer where it was leading to . when elizabeth wilson has the film's last word and says , " you don't know how good it is to hear my family laughing again , " this coming after they acted as snipers , which leaves the black humor with a very tainted message that bears watching . 
an updated version from the '60s one , remade with a fresher theme that is fit for the '90s . the caper is also more fun to watch , has much more splash to its story line , and is better looking than the original . in many ways it's a better overall film than the steve mcqueen one , but retains the same trashy disposable entertainment value . no one will mistake this middle brow venture for an art film . the film looked so glossy and flew by at such an easygoing pace , that it was an enjoyable guilty pleasure , a delicious hollywood film for those looking for escapism and a romance that portends to be steamy and intimate , but is really glib and only superficially satisfying . it's more like a james bond film in its banal idea of what love and adventure is , as the film rolls out the big-ticket items to impress the viewer . there is no end to the bounty of materialism in this film . in the closing scene , he steals another valuable picture hanging near the monet for catherine's sake , but he also puts the monet back in its place in the museum . it was an ingenious scene , where many impersonators of a magritte painting , who are dressed in imitation of the picture , as inconspicuous businessmen in dark suits and bowler hats , carrying briefcases , make it difficult for the police to keep tabs on them all . it's a fantasy film fantasizing how good it would be to have so much money that you can do anything you wanted . the emptiness of those pleasures rival the film's empty look at romance and adventure , and should give one pause to think how disappointing it sometimes might be to get what one wishes for . this is an easy film to take it as it is ! it is a well-crafted star vehicle , whose stars have a good chemistry together , and there is a bonus--it comes with gorgeous location shots and lots of plot twists .

this comedy/romance story is more about the sense of communication than it is about the mystery story or about the five senses the structure of its story is built around . it is done in a delicately stylized form , filmed mostly in dark , somber shades , as the story revolves around the characters in an office/residential building in toronto . the film moves along at a brisk pace , which kept me interested in their lives , but what the story failed to do was tell me all it can about the characters . nevertheless , i was satisfied with the film and the very sensitive nature it tapped into , as it touched a nerve in each one's character and left me caring about them , despite thinking that maybe the characters were a bit shallow . this engrossing film touches on the fears people have who are losing their senses and how they must rely on the sense that is their strongest to pull them through their difficulties . rona struggles to understand herself through the sense of taste that is both her strong and weak point . they are seen slyly talking to each other about what to avoid in a relationship , since they have both experienced many failed ones they have much in common . this sequence didn't have the flow to it the others did , and even though it was touching to see , it seemed too calculated to have much of an affect . jeremy podeswa ( eclipse ) , the writer-director , has come up with a captivating film despite the shallowness of the characters and the story being a landmine full of clich ? s . there are things shown in the relationships uncovered that bring out so many emotional qualities , as this independent film takes risks on a story line that borders on being perceived as too arty , but somehow it works because it has something to say about relationships that are so painful to bear . that i didn't get to know as much about the characters as i would have liked , gets overridden by how well the story was presented . i don't think the film would have worked if it weren't for the nuanced ways of the film and if it tried to tidy up everyone's life by the finale . the point being made , is that it is the small little things one does to stimulate one's senses that counts the most , whether it is when one reaches out for another , or when just trying to understand someone else and giving them succor , that it is by using one's senses to connect with someone else that makes life worth living . these revelations were too banal to make this more than an intriguing film . but , the story did catch and hold my interest . 
this psychological thriller is based on john hopkin's play " this story of yours . " this is a brilliantly acted picture , especially the performances of both sean connery as the veteran policeman but the now emotionally tortured inquisitor , sgt . the film was in some ways spoiled but not ruined by the pretentiously arty way it was directed . it framed its shots in an exaggerated arty manner , which took away from the subtlety of the unfolding story . he identifies so much with what the perp is thinking , that he can just look at him and know if he did the crime or not . the story then goes into a flashback and we see sgt . the audience knows that he is guilty because we saw him at the scene of the crime . in this claustrophobic holding-room , johnson bullies baxter , while baxter sneers at him in a mocking tone . the film remains fascinating , aided by impeccable performances and a dialogue that has some bite in it . the film might appear too stagy for some , but i found it an absorbing experience . it held my interest throughout . 
a bitter-sweet fantasy , in the form of a black comedy . this is the first film he's done that's not written by him , as it was scripted by john c . richards/james flamberg . it is another heartless stab by the director aimed at the heart of mankind , showing them at their stupidest and cruelest moments , one that tweaks the sensibilities about american pop culture and its whimsical effect on the population . it uses the ridiculous banal plot of a soap opera called 'a reason to love' and manages to get a story that runs parallel . this modern adult fairy tale , told in the style of the " wizard of oz , " is also set in kansas and has the heroine , ala dorothy , leaving that rational state for one of fantasy . the humor comes in how the characters actually fall for the fantasy they are spoon fed by tv . she never misses an episode and identifies solely with a nurse chloe , even knowing the nurse's lines by heart . it would take a suspension of disbelief to take in what ensued after the murder and not question it . the film has another gory murder scene , as it breaks the mood of fantasy and returns to a reality that is even more absurd than the fantasy world . a bloody shootout occurs and everything that can get straightened out does as a result of that . but it was not possible for me to believe anything about this tale , especially the purported sweet ending tried for . this tale was spiced with too much human depravity and insanity , making betty to be anything but another dorothy gale , but more like a crazy person or an idiot . i found this adult fairy tale to be one that was trapped in its own mixture of cynicism and delusions . the director could never quite decide on what he wanted betty to be like , so i was left with the impression that she was a cartoon-like character , not able to distinguish what was real or fantasy . i don't think the film has come up with some earth shattering things to say about pop culture , except to imply that if you want to be a moron and forego taste , then join the middle-brow masses and get absorbed in soap operas and forego any kind of art that makes you think for yourself . if you do , the director is saying , that is not the worst thing that can happen to you , it doesn't have to kill you . but it is never clear what labute thinks of this , that is , after smashing the middle-class dream of america as something that is drab . is he further saying that it is better to have some dream no matter how futile it is than no dream at all ? if his other two nihilistic films are examples of his thinking , then i think he is trying to bring that same message into this work , even though it might not have been intended in this script and doesn't exactly jive with the sweet ending tried for . i just think it seemed like old hat material recycled . what the film had going for it was some marvelous performances , especially by morgan freeman , who touched the soul of his complicated character , a wickedly carnal performance from chris rock , and from greg kinnear , who caught the subtlety needed for his role , to swing back and forth between tv actor and real character . as for ren ? e zellweger's performance , it was good , that is , as good as any on the soaps . 
a heartfelt australian romance story about a mentally ill couple , which won seven australian academy awards , including best picture , actor , actress and director . there are many magnificent scenes of them showing their love for each other in a sensitive and witty way , also showing how fragile and insecure they are . the director shows how the outsiders only seem to harm them , even when they are trying to be fair with them and offer them sound advise . but we can rest assured that this is not going to be a clich ? movie about the mentally ill and how they manage , as the acting remains controlled and is too earthy for the story to become compromised by a sugary resolution . this is a sensitive film . the director-writer , rymer , makes sure that our sympathies lie entirely with the struggling couple without making the outsiders into monsters . its beauty lies in how honestly the story is told and in showing how difficult it is to find love and then lose it through something you have no control over . it's an absorbing film , that is well-acted and directed , but it is not a film that you might care to remember . it lacked real affection for the couple , as they seemed forced down our throats instead of being allowed to grow gradually on us . having pity for them , is not the same as really caring for them . 
shot almost entirely on digital video with a hand-held camera , miguel arteta's ( star maps ) chuck and buck is an arresting homo-erotic tale about the pangs of growing up while still stuck emotionally at an adolescent stage . these scenes are the heart of the film , as they bring out whatever brilliance there is to be found in the characterizerations , depicting in an honest way how those who are not destined to live a conventional life behave with each other in a natural setting . the film allowed the supporting characters to interact with each other , not going for the cheap comedy it could have gone after by just making fun of buck's tortured character . this makes the supporting characters not that much different than buck as to their feelings of insecurity . a gnawing flaw to this film is that it hits a dead spot , which comes after the play is presented . the thinly disguised autobiographical play , embarrasses chuck . the film seemed to run out of steam at that point , having exhausted itself of its underlying probe into the tormented soul of buck , who is seen more as a pathetic figure who is desperately in need of being touched , someone who does not possess the social skills to relate with others . the film takes a few deep breathes and returns for a discerning conclusion , which was thoroughly credible and well-presented . a tremendous effort by the indie film-makers is realized to tell a moving character study , thereby achieving such a high-quality film on such a low-budget , as it daringly rests its unsentimental case on such a thin plot and succeeds because its characterizations came to life and the effort to look at friendship and human behavior was an honest one . it is also a disarmingly funny movie . 
it was done on an extremely low budget , where the actors received no pay but were promised a percentage of the profits . for this series of films , he thought why not keep the same theme , just switch the story around . it is quite evident that rohmer finds the women in this story more interesting than the men , even if the main woman in it is impossible to understand . this is rohmer before he mastered his craft , but there are signs here of the greatness that was to come in his later films , as its rawness makes up for its lack of sophisticated form and nonstop chatter . nowadays rohmer films are out of favor with modern audiences , and are considered old-fashioned . his films seem to attract an audience mostly aged 50 or older and those looking for something less spectacular to hone in on than what is typically seen in today's films . the film is loaded with an erotic tension , as rohmer's camera remains fixed on her perfect body , her pagan-like bronzed figure and her attractive short-cropped haircut . this film is all about the romantic chase and how these three play it as a game . rohmer puts all of them under the microscope and they become like philosophers . some of the talk is witty but not comical , some of it is merely egotistical babble , but the film never fails to be diverting , aiming for the small dilemmas one has in life as being the most important things , either just or more important than the big world events that influence nations . adrien is the most annoying of the three , being the most smug , the one who counts on his good looks and elitist intellectualism to smother the other person . this is a very wry film not suited for all tastes , but it is a good introduction to the early rohmer , that has a lot to say about human nature and says it in a very french way . the film radiates with the charms derived from so-called sophisticated pleasures and a sneaky sense of perversion . 
the film is slightly offbeat , feeling very natural and human , and offering a chance for the characters to be somewhat fleshed out as they intermingle and search for relationships . the film played well and was enjoyable in poking holes at how insincere and ready for a downfall the main character was , but the obvious plot and the predictable way the film was going , defeated its zen-like approach , wanting too much to resolve things by contrivances instead of surrendering to a more natural ending . yet i enjoyed the film and its loopy moments and thought it did a good job of catching the banter that goes on between the twenty-somethings , struggling to make relationships and fight their fear of loneliness . dex is seen interacting with his roommates in an engaging way , still acting like he hasn't matured . but he has met his match with syd , as the two discuss kierkegaard's dark secret nature and compare it with the opera don giovanni , which takes on the film's theme and makes way for relating that to the eventual transcendence of dex . that this film works in the way most romantic hollywood films work from since when , with its storybook ending intact . . . did not disturb me to the point of dismissing the film . that the script allowed this unlikely romance to succeed no matter what , never deterred it from being a fun film . the film reminded me of those old-fashioned hollywood studio films of the '30s and '40s , only updated to take in the new trends and hip language used by those living in modern times . 
there are also some interesting casting choices he makes such as , a cameo for angie dickinson as gwyneth's grandmother and the noted singer huey newton in a starring role , whose expressions and looks reminded me of sydney pollack . this story is the most bizarre and implausible , but it has the strength of bringing out a number of small truths that add up , allowing the film to maintain a quirky sense of justification for its messiness . its impact is helped greatly by the engagingly nuanced performances of giamatti and braugher . the two things this film has going for it in spades , is the lively karaoke music and the unpredictability of its comedy , which gives the film a very fresh feel , even overcoming the nonsense of its interconnected stories and awkward sense of drama . these stories don't exactly connect for these disenfranchised folks , but it shows what happens to them psychologically when they come to a crossroads in omaha , making it appear to be the super bowl for dreamers in the world of karaoke -- their chance to heal their wounded egos as they steal someone else's talent for a few moments and call it theirs . the film starts off in a karaoke bar in tulsa , where ricky is a karaoke hustler , if there is such an animal as that , it's new to me -- but his thing is to bet other performers that he can top them , betting a huge sum of money over the usual $100 first-place prize . there is also a trip to omaha for the winner , where the competition is national and the prize money is significantly higher at $5 , 000 , but considering the way money has been thrown around in contests with less skill than this one , this is still a very low figure as a payoff . she does a marvelous rendition of " bette davis eyes . " but their story was rather tame , as there was nothing touching about their relationship and nothing revealed that wasn't expected , it played as if something was left out but that it wasn't important to find out what that was . yet their chemistry was good together , making their story most watchable one . the story that seemed the most forced was the cabbie and the whore on the run one . this vignette took its dramatics too seriously and explained their obvious emergency relationship in too fine a matter for how absurd it all seemed . i must applaud the film for not emphasizing the competition at the contest , as so many recent commercial films have in such films , and for taking a chance and going for some dramatic fireworks in a screwball comedy . that it doesn't always come together as a fluid film , is pushed aside by how zany and entertaining it was , with a good sense of energy released through some risks that were taken by not trying to put together a familiar film . i have a good feeling about this film and think it will stay around as a cult favorite and grow in status over the years . 
there is no dialogue or narrator in the first version i saw , but in the later version ed mcmahon does the narration . these are some very weird freudian dream sequences . but the narrator poses the question , is it a dream of madness on a dark night -- or was it real ? this is a bizarre film , a precursor to welles' " touch of evil " and polansky's " repulsion . " if not made to be understandable , it is at least a very demanding depiction of someone demonically possessed by guilt . 
the first-time director does a great job of establishing character in this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class milieu , also catching the need for dignity walken has and how the other characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with their own particular tics . donal logue seems like he's a real guy from the neighborhood , his performance was so real it didn't seem like it was a performance . vera farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter . what's there not to like about this robbery ! it is hard for the audience to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper . it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel . there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to . the first-time director does a great job of establishing character in this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class milieu , also catching the need for dignity walken has and how the other characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with their own particular tics . donal logue seems like he's a real guy from the neighborhood , his performance was so real it didn't seem like it was a performance . vera farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter . what's there not to like about this robbery ! it is hard for the audience to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper . it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel . there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to . ozus@sover . net 
it is noted for the understated but tense performance by anthony perkins and the electric and a very passionate performance by geraldine chaplin , where you can actually feel her pain and sympathize with her even though she's the aggressor . setting the dark and torturous mood with her soundtrack is alberta hunter's most appealing blues score , which she also performs . tak fujimoto's camera is sharp in its character delineation , cutting deeply into this tale of revenge with its powerful close-ups . a sense of foreboding violence and a quirky sense of humor go very well together in this film , as emily has this crazed and confused look about her and speaks in an unnatural almost comical tone , as if she forgot how to speak and is learning it anew . she succeeds in messing with neil's life and gains the viewer's sympathy , as she seems to be more of a victim than at first thought . the irony in it , is all the main characters watch the news report , but it is too impersonal for them to even react to it , they are too overwhelmed with the problems in their personal life to care about anyone else . i remembered emily's name by the time the film ended , and felt moved by her strained performance and all the emotions , pathos , and humor that was in it . the film was too arty at times , as is the want of the director , but it is a gripping film , one that i recommend for the way it outstandingly depicts the subtleties in the way the characters act . 
a thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller , the second feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was once a film critic , rod lurie ( deterrence ) . he has vastly honed his skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film , which was a failure artistically and commercially . " the contender " is a film that is grounded in having a clear understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and how those in it operate on a level that would make machiavelli proud of them . i was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is , with the leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles , even if they have to chew the scenery to do it . the cast is so good that it overcomes the shrill oratory , the manipulative , obvious and unbelievable political situations , and an ending that tries to play it so safe , that it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in the first place . i thoroughly enjoyed it , even though i knew it was a manipulative film , trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the double-standards between men and women politicians , without giving me a fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what i was asked to swallow . this only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a muenster cheese sandwich . there was something about that action that didn't seem right . it will later on play an important part in the film's plot . it makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position would be . hanson refuses to comment on the issue , taking the high moral ground , saying it is no one's business but her own . senator hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian . the story in itself is more soap opera than drama , but what gives it verve is the super performances from the three stars , jeff bridges , gary oldman , and joan allen . they give depth to their roles and they are all seen in many different lights and shades . jeff bridges steals every scene he is in , offering a fascinating look at a president who could be likable though sinister , sneakily clever , and also very politically human in a generous and gracious way . he was thoroughly believable as an updated bill clinton-type , post-lewinsky . this film is a pro-clinton one , taking aim at those who dig up dirt and cast aspersions in a hypocritical way , when it is evident that both sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their own cause . the film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to deliver with some bogus pat speech and , instead , set up a logical argument showing that senator hanson should be confirmed for office despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal . 
this pleasing film plays like a docudrama , with the director youssef chahine playing himself in the film . he feels amr is an even better actor than he was , and therefore feels hurt that amr is threatening to walk away from this part . chahine said he was quite sure that he was talking to him , as he was a young man sitting intently in the audience , quite in awe of the great actor . yet , when the shoot is over , amr tells how kind and considerate the director could be when off the set . it reminded me of a jacques rivette musical , mixing reality and fantasy into a scene where you wouldn't think it possible to do so . cahine goes on to make two more pictures in this film within a film , alexandria and cleopatra . the scenes are colorfully shot on a studio location , while it also shows him writing and directing the actors , as they go from song and dance numbers into serious acting sketches . the creative , political and personal struggles of the filmmaker were well-presented and superbly acted , in this imaginative and enchanting production . it is a zesty film , adopting many different themes and styles , from gene kelly dance numbers to fellini fantasy scenes . 
a screwball comedy set in harrisburg , pa . , in 1988 , where the ethics for the main characters become so twisted allowing everyone in the film to be perceived as either an incompetent jerk or an incompetent crook . nora ephron directs this farce with the aim to mine all the laughs taken from the foibles of the slow-witted characters and pull all the nuggets out of their characterizations that adam resnick scripted , as the film holds up rather well until the clumsily navigated tidied up ending , which made no ethical sense . the film's main assets are in the sterling cast , who all have a flair for making their roles brim with comedy . the key ingredient to this comedy , is john travolta , who was never better in a comic role , and the good chemistry between him and lisa kudrow , who as a sexpot with a heart of steel , is just fabulous in making her character both despicable and amusingly likable . we see in the opening moments , that he's a narcissistic jerk but one who's so corny and willing to please , that he's oddly acceptable as a human being . it was a brilliant comic set-up , which gave the film a delicious comic aroma . for this one mistake , he is made to suffer for it during the entire film . his slow-thinking process and keen sense of timing to draw out the comic situation , made his role a very funny one . this was a satisfying comedy ( the best way to judge a comedy is if you are laughing -- and , i was ) . it was effortlessly well-acted , with plenty of sight gags and changes of facial expression on the bewildered characters to make almost every scene a funny one . " lucky numbers " didn't hit the jackpot , as the story was too shallow to allow for that , but i got some good comedy action for the price of the movie ticket .

a solid noir melodrama from vincent sherman , who takes a standard story and dresses it up with moving characterizations and beautifully expressionistic b&w photography from cinematographer james wong howe . the director took a songwriter paul webster's short magazine story called " the man who died twice " and improved the story by rounding out the characters to give them both strong and weak points , so that they would not be one-note characters as was the case in the original story . the movie posters said , 'if you were nora prentiss , would you keep your mouth shut ? ' the other famous quote from this film is 'a mouth like hers is just for kissing . . . not for telling ! ' the film proved to be popular with the public , especially with the women in the audience , and it turned out to be a big hit for ann sheridan . the glossy story might not be much on paper , but the telling of it was superb , showing how trapped the main characters became because of their lie . 
the film is told from his view of things . it is a deliberate film , doing a grand job of setting up the characters and the tough situation they are in , with the visuals telling the story as powerfully as it can . the brick fights between the rival gangs and the angst of the mother , not understanding what to do , seemed genuine , in this semi-autobiographical work by the mackinnon brothers , gillies and billy . spoiler in the next paragraph about the film's ending . it is a film that tried to say more than what it is capable of saying , but when it was on message , it had a stunning affect , showing how the lack of good parenting and a poor environment could be deadly . it caught something real about growing up in such a rough environment , but the acting was not that great by the kids and when all is said and done , the brothers were made into stock characters . 
this is a quintessential john ford western . there are all his stock characters present , the rousing song to stir one's heart is there as the cavalry troops ride by with stan jones singing 'i left my love , ' there is the formula story of the men in order to be respected proving themselves in combat , and finally the film has ford's ongoing patriotic message that this country is for everyone who has the guts to fight for it . the film proves more interesting than its predictable outcome because of ford's odd touches in certain scenes and john wayne , who is who he is , giving the film a powerful symbol . there is no plan made for how they are to return to friendly territory , except they should incur as few casualties as possible . ford is more interested in the characters in the story than the story itself . secord does his job but is too ambitious and sleazy to be thought of as a hero . ford does not put up with cowards in his films . the film has a lot of gory scenes of surgery , which included showing the amputation of a leg . in ford's oeuvre , this film would rate somewhere in the middle or slightly better than that , it couldn't quite get past all its static formula presentations to be a great film , but it threw out some diverting ideas , making it a greater film than a typical western . 
an amazingly strange film , confusing and not thoroughly enjoyable , but a film i found more interesting than i thought possible at first viewing . this experimental film in minimalist story telling , a film consisting of disturbing visualizations and almost no dialogue , had a concept that was greater than how the film turned out . it felt at times like i was watching paint dry on the wall , but the reward for sitting through those excruciatingly redundant scenes , was in seeing something different , something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident , as i believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice in commenting on the violence in american society , especially against women . the film uses its impressions of the marine base as a metaphor for the social violence in today's american society , and to give it its startling look of reality , marines were used as the actors . the plot is simple . the film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to little snippets of , hearing mostly their curse words . because the film had no linear story and followed no chronological order , and it stressed the mundaneness of life on the base and did not film its story in the usual way a murder investigation is filmed , it appeared surreal . i thought these additions seemed to serve mostly as unneeded arty pretext . the unsettling milieu in which the crime took place , speaks volumes about why the murder might have taken place . the film seems to be telling us that it's up to us to make sense of what we've seen . though the film was dull and did not move me while i was watching it , it did something to me afterwards intellectually , it made me think of a military base , the persian gulf war , and of marital abuse , but it made me think of them without the usual concepts i bring to my thinking cap . does that make this a great film ? no . but it makes it an interesting one , a film that i can't easily dismiss . its filming of the arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary about the crime scene , is the understated reason for the origin of the violence , contrary to the way hollywood films portray violence . here it is a part of the landscape that one regularly sees but , perhaps , one doesn't really understand or want to understand what evil society has created . 
don roos ( " the opposite of sex " ) , the director-screenwriter , has come up with a smart script and lets his adult stars act like real adults do and is not ashamed of the glossy film becoming a tearjerker , and when the romance story tugs shamelessly at my heart it feels good because there is a heartfelt rhythm in this film that allowed me to clearly see what the troubled couple is feeling without it seeming to be contrived , even though it is contrived . in fact , the film is thoroughly engrossing and well-crafted until the closing scenes , where some speeches are made to clear the air , which seemed totally unnecessary . what helped carry the film through such contrived spots , was the real-life romantic couple who star in the film , ben affleck and gwyneth paltrow , playing two hurt souls who don't expect to fall in love but do . they had great chemistry onscreen , and paltrow in particular , seemed to make the story appealing and credible . in the hollywood tradition of such love stories , it seemed easy for the audience to root for them to get together and make the romance work . the only thing is , that the film is a little tougher than how most mainstream films do romances but is not edgy enough to be an art film , so it falls into the category of being not one or the other type of film , which might cause it to be ignored by both audiences . sex is not presented as the prize here , as much as a serious and meaningful relationship is . it has probably been ages since that theme was tried as seriously as it was in this mainstream film , and that just might be the most refreshing thing about the film . since paltrow is the better actor , she mops up the screen in these scenes of anguish and is convincing as someone who has been damaged and is afraid of getting hurt again . affleck is good as an actor conveying someone who is arrogant and shallow and full of false bravado , but is not convincing as someone who has been down for the count and is bouncing back as a changed man . it left me wondering , how sensitive of a person could he really have become , if he could only help her materially and not understand that his drinking masked deeper problems he had in his character , such as lying ! but the film had enough of a realistic romance under its belt to not be buried for dead with its contrivances . in additition it had some pretty good players in supporting roles . joe morton always gives a fine performance , and here as the sturdy , no-nonsense businessman he grounds the film in some needed reality . this modest production scored with me . and if it didn't have that phony civil court scene at the end , with affleck forced to act in such a disingenuously apologetic manner , the film would have been much better . but i was glad to be taken in by what i was seeing onscreen , that is an adult romantic film , with the adults interested in having a real relationship . i'm so conditioned by now , that i think only foreign films or art house films operate that way . 
without any proof , ellen fails to believe him . the story had a lot of holes in it , including an inadequate explanation for budd's motivation for wanting dorothy dead in the first place , but it still played as a good nightmarish mystery yarn , with an icy robert wagner tremendous in a villain role for a change of pace from his usual good guy roles . 
this is a creaky horror film , with plenty of fun moments in its wobbly story . it is played mostly as a spoof on vampires , but has a nifty murder mystery going for it , plus some gimmicky camera work featuring an apparition and the scary dark castle filled with strange sounds , cobwebs , spiders , bats , and rodents . he tries to steal the picture by hamming it up , even though he only has one line in the film . but the biggest ham is barrymore , he makes every line into a stage-like performance . this amusing b&w film , with photography by james wong howe , captures the eerie atmosphere befitting a horror film . it's a classic horror spoof , well worth seeing for either nostalgia purposes or lighthearted fun . 
bruce robinson , the creative director and writer of " withnail and i , " has come up once again with an original film , which again stars richard e . grant . " how to get ahead in advertising " is a tirade against the phony world of advertising and the screams denouncing that industry seemed like sweet music to my ears up to a point , as the message of the film eventually moved from being funny to becoming shrill and overwhelming , even to someone like me who was sympathetic to the script . ad men could very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet earth , is a point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before i get it . the point being made , is that both the business world and the world of science are ready to sell almost any product to make a buck , as they both exist by giving the public what they want . this is a film that rants on throughout , as it starts off very funny and then moves into sermonizing about the corrupt industry . the huckster's motto being : if you want to sell pimple cream , you have to encourage people to have pimples . the cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility required , with richard grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous ability to verbalize . it's an unusual picture , one worth a look at for those who don't mind pure nuttiness instead of dramatics and tension in a story . it sounds far-reaching , a ghastly cry against the excesses of materialism , or does it ? 
a snappy b-film thriller , excellently paced for broad sweeps of comedy and fright . lew ayres stars in a film he says in a magazine interview , " is the kind of picture actors do when they need work . " basil rathbone , who was a big star at the time of this film , had a small part as the villain . ayres is endearing as the misunderstood actor who will only be with a woman who doesn't lie . together they make an engaging couple , bringing a wonderful sense of lightness to their roles . the story is as clear as mud , but the performances from the stars was sparkling . and , even though the film might be dated , it's still a lot of fun . 
somehow this quirky , egocentric , fantasy black-and-white film about a british filmmaker learning to dance the tango from a master , works in an obscure way by getting us hooked on what's going on . it works so well because the dancing was so natural and magnificently performed , even if the wistful romantic story never caught my imagination and the philosophizing about her being a jew seemed more diverting than engrossing ( in real-life she's not jewish but an avowed atheist who was only influenced by her jewish neighbors and their culture ) . the 48-year-old sally potter ( she plays herself ) , while filming in paris a technicolor thriller ( it seemed like dreck and is probably some kind of personal statement potter is making about hollywood films ) about a legless fashion designer in a wheelchair murdering models dressed in brightly colored costumes . " i've always wanted to be in films , " says the thirtysomething pablo . it sounds like a trade-off in self-indulgences , and all i can say , is why not ! when sally dances the tango in the film , that's really her and not a double . and if she can dance the part , why not play the part ! for whatever arcane reason ( or most likely no reason at all ) , the story has twelve dance lessons which come to divide the film into chapters . she returns to paris after being disappointed that her hollywood backers complained that it would be better for the box office if the film was to be in english instead of french and that she should cast a different villain because it would be difficult to cast a legless person . she shoots back , " you danced as a soloist -- like a stranger -- and i lost you . " somehow i couldn't be convinced of their romance , in fact , i never cared about it . it seemed empty , and to the bargain she's no beauty . but . . . ah ! those dancing scenes were tremendous , along with the penetrating cinematography of the great robby m ? ller , giving the film such a stunning look . the film managed to look good and even though pablo and sally are no great shakes as actors , and their stiff romance was more pitiful than meaningful , the film had a bizarre strain to it , of this very uptight sally learning how to loosen up and the sly pablo jumping around like a fox at a hunt . it seemed to be a mix of reality and script , but hard to tell which was which . when they weren't dancing or figuring out what kind of arrangement they were going to have , such as if their dancing partnership would include any funny business , they discussed what it is like being a jew . i couldn't quite warm up to this debate about art . the film is short on plot , short on acting , short on getting me involved in the romance , but most of the film had potter and veron dancing and that had me jumping with joy , even believing that there was something spiritual to the tango , a dance which is a mixture of cuban and european styles , created by the lower-classes and elevated to the status of the ballroom , a dance created in this century , that maybe is even akin to the rapturous eastern european klezmer music . this is an inspiring dance film that covers some ground in exploring what the tango is and how that dance reflect's one's life and suffering , and to understand that is to begin to understand what the tango is about and what this film was trying to get at . 
a steamy noir for its time , featuring the sultry , long hair-tossing rita hayworth , the hard-boiled glenn ford , and the sinister george macready . this is sexpot rita's finest moment in films as an actress and chanteuse , which enshrined her as the love goddess of the 1940s . this theme takes hold of this dark film and overshadows the milder intrigue about macready , himself a nazi collaborator , fronting for a nazi-controlled tungsten cartel . a fascinating film for all the dark avenues it opened up sexually for future films . the film is all style and charismatic acting . the story is absurd and could not be anything but risible , if if wasn't for the bizarre performances by the stars to give it credibility . the clearest summation of the story comes in the film's most sensational and memorable scene , as gilda is dressed in a tight-fitting black satin evening gown and sings 'put the blame on mame , ' intoning in an erotic manner what is eating away at johnny while suggesting a full striptease by removing a glove . spoiler in the next paragraph . skip if you don't want to know how the story is resolved . rita was simply stupendous here and makes this slight b-film a memorable one . the film could be viewed as a study in the main characters' pathologies and of a peeling away of the unconscious , highlighted by the hinting of a quasi-gay relationship between macready and glenn , where they only care about loyalty and do not seem to care what else they have in common . this emotionally charged love triangle is better acted than its silly story sounds . it's a studio film , with even its revealing carnival scene , an unloading of sexual repression and delve into the unconscious , done indoors on the cheesy hollywood set . 
the payoff in the film comes in a slick surprise ending , as now has become the custom of the director and is what the audience expects . night has honed his skills from his previous films by showing an improvement in technique and filmmaking style , while continuing his penchant for making films with box-office pop . though there is a certain disdainful emptiness in this film , as there was in his others , but this film sustains itself with the keen performances by the understated one bruce willis gives and the punctiliously perverse one samuel l . jackson gives , as the film is able to amble along at its leisurely pace , building on character development and the unique relationship the two stars develop , until the mystery story takes hold in the last twenty minutes and puts the exclamation point on the far-fetched tale it was weaving . this subdued action film is unlike other action-hero films , as the action is not the thing here . what counts the most , is what secret the film is covering up and why . it is especially delightful for those who like puzzlers and think they can gather enough clues to take a stab at guessing the outcome . even though night has matured as a director , this surprise ending is not as engaging as the one he came up with in the blockbuster the sixth sense , which caught audiences completely off-guard . but this film is a more mature work and has fuller characterizations . so the former has arguably a better ending , but this one is a better realized overall film . the basic plot is simple . as his face changes expressions , we can sense something tragic is about to happen . elijah believes that david may be the 'unbreakable' person he is looking for , someone to give hope for this mediocre age we live in , as he believes the super-hero myth is as true as if it was history -- which is asking a lot for an adult audience to swallow , but . . . that's hollywood ! and if he has a weakness , it might be water , as even superman had a weakness from kryptonite . his reasoning supposes -- " if there is someone like me in the world , shouldn't there be someone at the other end of the spectrum ? " the major stumbling block , to this otherwise involving film , is the let down in the third act . the action in it seemed obligatory and not really germane to the story , as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced to prove that david has the super-powers of the comic book hero . this encounter , of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked right , as it seemed flat and arbitrary , spoiling but not ruining the overall achievement of the film . what this unconventional mainstream film did right for itself , was to provide a modern type of super-hero for an audience that thrives on escapist films that can fill them with some hope that there's a savior out there in the fight between good and evil ( something hollywood films could always be counted on to provide the public with ) . it is a film that is confident enough of its ability to tell its story that it doesn't have to rely on special effects . and , perhaps , as an homage to hitchcock or maybe it's a case of egomania , night once again appears in his own film . 
it is artfully directed by leconte , with his choppy camera work matching the mediterranean's bubbly sea movements and the trembling nature of the feature players , plus his smoothly dark photography makes it seem as if he's filming a 1940s noir work , and his eclectic musical background soundtracks ( ranging from benny goodman to marianne faithfull and from italian to turkish music ) adds an excitement to a story that changes moods from comical to tragical at the drop of a knife . it should be noted , in the director's biggest joke he has with the audience , how the background music plays a large part in the enjoyment of the film . when the film is playful and lighthearted , it is sublime and masterfully done . unfortunately , when the last reel comes , the film shifts gears and starts to take its philosophical musings about chance and luck seriously , and the film becomes contrived and loses much of its punch . the power in the film's punch comes mostly from the imaginative performances of international pop star vanessa paradis , the girlfriend of johnny depp , and from one of france's most popular and best actors , daniel auteuil . these two have an electricity together that is , indeed , magical , with both featuring very expressive facial gestures and large eyes that open wider when welcoming the viewer into their story in a most hospitable way . perhaps any film with subtitles ( especially subtitles that are hard to read ) and one that is shot in black-and-white , can only be relegated to a select audience . or , maybe , a knife-thrower act in a circus venue is art in america , while in paris it might be viewed as the old -- seen that , done that thing . she is so persuasive , that we know everything about her that we have to from this brief opening look at her , so much so that when she shifts her eyes , we even know what she is thinking . now that's the start of a lifetime friendship , if you ask me . there was something bizarre about the act that was movie magic . . . fake magic , i grant you , but magical enough to keep me glued to my seat in anticipation of what will happen to her , as leconte also had the circus sideshow entourage gasping with concern . i think he might even have expected the theater viewer to be masturbating over this . my favorite tryst , was her and the contorsionnist making it on top of the piano ( the sex act itself is only imagined and is tastefully not seen -- but can you imagine how they did it ? ) . the film then moves off the map of credible filmmaking and becomes silly and contrived , probably imitative of those cartoonish-like action films , where there is a daring helicopter rescue of the couple adrift at sea . for a film that was so sublime and had such an enchanting mystical romance going for it , it foolishly throws that all away to make its cheap points about chance and to show how if two souls that fit together like two halves of a money bill , will only have value if it does not get torn apart , which is too heavy-handed a message for this bubbly film to handle . the film should have been a more far-reaching one and it could have been much funnier if it didn't go on the wrong cruise toward the end . but what we have is still a visually spellbinding film and one where vanessa and danny prove to be very human creatures , who are worth caring about . what i still came up with , is that they are both good at flirting with disaster , but what they both have in spades , is a whimsical sense of humor and a strange sense of survival , and just like serge frydman's script , which was both witty and superfluous , the film nevertheless succeeded in sucking me into its story , a story which probably implied more about it than it actually delivered . but , despite this and that about it that seemed to me as if it was drifting off into the territory of play acting , i still thought it was a smart film . 
in reality that was a time of great poverty and unrest and this film serves as a humanistic response to that age of intolerance and greed , though the film does not make a direct political statement . this is his first film in ten years and it is sponsored by the chinese government , and one of its chief faults is that the film used bad film stock , as it seemed out of focus and grainy . on the positive side , it is a colorful and heart-tugging though highly manipulative melodrama , filled with obvious reactions against injustices , but whose voice is always on the side of the artist and those who are disenfranchised in society . the film will go on to dispel china's ancient notions that a girl is not as valuable as a boy . the film becomes predictable , as it shows how they are both shaped by their experiences of the hard-times they live in and by the traditions . as a result , when the film's last act rolls around , what happens all feels contrived and overacted , and i felt manipulated , especially when i saw that the sweet little girl is even willing to die for her grandpa . though the viewer is being shamelessly manipulated , the story feels so strong and right , that it seems easy to get caught up in the emotions of the moment and the beautifully arranged images that lit the screen up with magical faces and gorgeous sets and costumes . the film got ever so mushy , but it was so cleverly executed and i was gladly taken in by zhou ren-ying and zhu xu pulling on my heart strings . 
a nifty postmodern cowboy-noir and black comedy , filmed in a drab technicolor that seems appropriate for this film , as the colorization is not ostentatious and thereby makes the characters appear more real . the story is aimed at striking your funny bone and getting you dizzy in following all the plot twists . it features all the familiar noir clich ? s : femme fatale , an innocent man trapped in the world of criminals , and is written by the dahl brothers and directed with tongue-in-cheek humor by john dahl , and despite the clich ? s , the film feels original . it's the type of film that seems to be best-suited for video , where it still made its biggest splash . but not our hero . . . who is neither straight nor crooked , just a guy who gets into tight spots and tries to do what is right . all this happens in the first reel . " red rock west " is a playful and off-beat thriller , whose only sense it makes is nonsense , but one that is highly entertaining , while the film itself is well executed and the acting is dead-pan funny . so it hardly matters that this murky story is not plausible and certainly not cerebral . it has received cult status because of its many plot twists and zany characters , which means it will pop up on late night cable at any time in the future and that should be for years to come . 
honestly . spoiler in the next paragraph . their superb characterizations about the cowboy's hard life and romantic visions , living as loners , often traveling on dusty roads into one-horse towns while hanging out in tawdry bars , gives this film a special force , filled with a moody noirish atmosphere . 
this made-for-tv thriller provides plenty of mystery . it's a story that crosses religion and spiritualism with worldly cynicism and murder . arquette is excellent in an understated performance . robards brings a certain sense of tragic power to his role . while under the capable direction of mike hodges ( get carter ) , the film is superbly paced and plays up the ambiguity of the story in a satisfactory manner . the result is a stimulating film for the intellect and a challenge for establishing what one's reality is . 
carol reed's breakthrough film as a director after a long and undistinguished film career . are just trying to figure out what to do that is right . he does not care that he would only be healing johnny so that the fugitive could be executed . that only help given without expecting something from it , is truly a christian charity . londoner reed has shot a pro-british film , that is stronger on being a suspenseful art film than an accurately political one . the dark rainy streets of belfast and the brooding mood of mason , made this film look much like a noir feature . it is preachy in spots , trying to show many different sides to the struggle , where characters along the way seem more like symbols than real flesh-and-blood . but the film was very weak in setting up the political arguments that caused the civil war in the first place , as no rational person will disagree with the film's anti-violent stance . but there is a lot going on that the film left uncovered from the point of view of what the revolutionaries are protesting . i found the film , nevertheless , absorbing , especially as a thriller--a 'cops and robbers' tale . 
a very good sequel to " the invisible man ( 33 ) , " though not as imaginative as the original . the search for the killer was too obvious to be interesting , but the fun to be had was when the side effects to the serum kicked in and geoffrey became egomaniacal . the film received a nomination for a special effects oscar in 1941 . 
a risky commercial venture that sometimes works in a serious way but is somewhat beaten down by the lack of vision it exhibits while in its romantic mode , as opposed to how alluring it was as a moralistic survival film . the film is carried solely by tom hanks' splendid performance , with him reflecting without the need of dramatics or dialogue the changes he is going through , as he acts through use of facial expressions and body language . the adventure story is reminiscent of a modern-day robinson crusoe tale , and is divided into three distinct parts , with tom hanks being the film's mainstay . the striking visuals and penetrating silence , give this film a surprising depth to its storytelling . he converses with it as if it were a human companion . there were times that this island fare seemed mildly poetic , but at other times it began to wear heavy as time dragged with only tom hanks on the screen to keep the fire going . yet the film had a certain appeal to it . . . a boldness not often seen in commercial films , as it bravely did without dialogue for great parts of the island story . this lent a certain sense of unpredictability to it and made the simple story lend itself to being more introspective and interestingly perceived . the major fault of the film lies in the capricious ending , where it ran out of story and didn't know how to make hanks' return to memphis and civilization shed some light on what he's been through without trivializing that experience . but what didn't resonate was the ambiguity of the film's ending . that is the simple point the film is trying to make and where the film should have ended , but when it tries to reinforce its sappy love story with characters who had too little screen time to have an effect on the story and it forces corny words on those characters in order to resolve hanks' love situation , the film thereby loses something by its hollywoodish formulaic message it tries desperately to land safely on . otherwise , a pleasing film from the director of forrest gump , robert zemeckis . one of his better ones . . . with the adventure part of the film having some appeal though not delving deep enough into the survivor's psyche for it to have an even greater appeal . but it was far superior to that recently popular survivor tv show , which had more to do about making a million bucks than surviving . 
the magic in the film did not come from the light comedy and the overworked romantic situation , which was mindful of a french farce , but from the sexy chemistry caught on the screen between the two and the way they looked natural dancing together . filmed during the heart of the depression , the film makes it a point to show how extravagant the rich lived , with not a care in the world for money . when he isn't scheming , he goes into the various song and dance numbers , some solo , some with her , and there's lots of verbal sparring to keep the film highly energized . the film's showdown takes place in venice , which is an artificially staged version of that great city , where madge is staying in this opulent but gaudy art deco hotel , waiting to play matchmaker and introduce jerry to dale . this catchy romantic farce should hit the mood of those in need of lighthearted escapism to cheer them up ; and with its show stopping musical routines , it has reached the status of being a film classic . it seems to be one of those films that doesn't get dated , and that glorious climax of " cheek to cheek , " with fred and ginger dancing as lovers , should lighten the hearts of those movie romantics out there . this sweeping musical , filmed in b&w , is delightful whether on video -- or if one is lucky enough to see it in on widescreen at a retrospective theater showing , then all the better . 
warning : the review includes an important spoiler in the first and last paragraph . there's a surprise that is revealed during the end credits : this fascinating documentary turns out to be a mock-documentary , after it hits you over the head with the problems facing many american workers during the changing times of the 1990s and spends the entire film looking like a real documentary . russ hexter , the 27-year-old writer-director , unexpectedly died of an aortic aneurysm shortly after shooting the innovative film , cutting short a possible brilliant career . the chasm between the locals and the newcomers is enormous , being caused mostly by a cultural clash . that it was not for real , does take away a lot of the film's impact and poignancy , but still it leaves the viewer with a sense that it cut through something perplexing that is currently happening , that is part of the human drama that causes some strange behavior to emerge . hexter has thrown open a look at all the social , political , and economic factors involved in the evolution of a small town , and he has done a nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most important thing to consider , even though in the bigger picture things might look like they are working out , there's still a face you have to put on someone who loses his job . 
i guess to really enjoy this film , you would have to speak the language to understand its poetical nuances , otherwise the poetry as presented didn't seem like much . as well-acted and crafted a film as this directorial debut was for ismail merchant , it still failed to make the story interesting for a wider audience , as the poetry fell on deaf western ears even though the story's heart seemed to be in the right place . the film still seemed to be too dry to care about an unfamiliar muslim language and an intellectual culture no longer in vogue , dying a slow death . as worthwhile a project as it is , as adapted from anita desai's 1987 novel , in which she also does the screenplay , it still is hard to bring an intact literary work and make it viable as a cinematic experience without changing it . the film's main failure is that it never comes to life as a moving poetical work but always seems like an academic exercise , through no fault of the director . the amateur poet in urdu is more than pleased to do so , though he does not feel secure that he is up to the task . he finally manages to squeeze a little money out of the college registrar , saying that he will make a tape-recording and the college can have the poet's voice to use as a valuable resource for its classes . the flawed poet has the even larger task , of being viewed as a symbol for the entire urdu tradition . it must have been a cultural thing , because it went by me . to me , her performance seemed as if it was as gaudy as an esther williams bathing suit number in a hollywood pulp film . but he is more harmful than helpful . these scenes were played as lowbrow comedy , showing the clumsiness of deven in handling the tapes and the awkward situation he was in . the acting performances by shashi kapoor and om puri deserve special praise . but i'm afraid the film was too stilted and unmoving ; and , it failed to capture the beauty of the ancient poetical language on film . 
the first thing you should be aware of about this controversial 1960 political film , shot in b&w by godard's favorite cinematographer raoul coutard , is that it was not shown until 1963 , as it had scenes in it that involved torture and terrorist tactics carried out by both the algerians and the french while waging the algerian war , which did not sit well with the french government that the public be made aware of this . writer-director jean-luc godard ( breathless ) allows his opinions to supercede the story line , making his films sound preachy and him self-indulgent . he often paints big political pictures that easily fall into generalizations . in his political assessments he is just as apt to be artless as he is to be riveting . that is the case in his second feature , the brooding atmospheric " le petit soldat . " godard did not really have a clear position on the war and wavered in his opinions of it just like the film's protagonist does , though probably having a position that was nearer to the one the right-wing had . the film was fun when it had this mixture of lighthearted romantic notions and a dark political mood to it , almost making it seem like a noir film . this results in temporarily turning off the energy the film seemed to have going for it . he says things that range from being inane to having some weight , such as bach is good to listen to at 8 am , mozart at 8pm , and beethoven at midnight . this early , minor work by godard , is a good example of how his films will later on look . le petit soldat suffers from flaws due to its poorly crafted plot and in the director's inability to tell a story that brings out all the dramatic tension . what his aim seems to be , revolves less around plot and more in telling about the stench coming from the algerian war , which is explored through bruno's intellectual musings . godard is most clear in showing that the left and right are two sides of the same coin . he is also innovative in his cinematography , challenging the conventional way of making a film by specializing in jump cuts and quick editing , which give a look of immediacy to the film . this film , thankfully , didn't have all the polemical fire in it that godard's later works had , instead there's much to find here that is enjoyable and i dare say perceptive , especially if you can overlook the director's pedantic ways . writer-director jean-luc godard ( breathless ) allows his opinions to supercede the story line , making his films sound preachy and him self-indulgent . he often paints big political pictures that easily fall into generalizations . in his political assessments he is just as apt to be artless as he is to be riveting . that is the case in his second feature , the brooding atmospheric " le petit soldat .

this is the movie not the perfume . a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo . it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way . 
testament of dr . the film was well-crafted , perfectly photographed in b&w , as it maintained a breezy pace and threw into the story some comedy and romance . they are not told how they will die until they hear a loud ticking sound . the whole feel of the movie is that it's brilliant hokum . aside from its serious political message , this was a slapstick comedy , and a mystery story much influenced by those american serials , which were very popular at the time . it is definetly worth seeing . 
but in robert altman's gentle and perceptive comedy , this is not enough . appropriately enough , this is a film set in the fall , and the mood and the color of the film reflects that time of year , in all its beauty and in its surprisingly stormy weather . she is baffled by her problem , but surmises it's a rare mythological complex that she suffers from , that affects only upper-class women who are loved too much and come to reject this love , retreating into a childlike state . she concurs that if anyone would know , it's him . at last , after many recent bombs , gere has found a film that goes hand in hand with his laconic style and intelligent grace , as he plays a sympathetic character , someone who seems very comfortable with this dazzling role around so many women and comes across as a good doctor and a generous person who is trying his best to be the man around a sea of women . there doesn't seem to be much tragedy here , it seems that script writer anne rapp and the 75-year-old altman are only gently chiding the doctor for thinking he can ever understand women , and the film plays more like a big joke on him than anything else . what unravels for him , are all things he can easily rebound from , as the film ends with the song " ain't it something the way things go " being played as the credits roll by , after an unpredictable ending to a sweetly bizarre film . 
this is a slight film as far as subject matter but it is richly endearing as a road movie that is a comedy-drama-romance-thriller rolled into one film , boasting big-time star power in brad pitt and julia roberts . it mostly roams between being a silly roughhouse crime caper and a film with some intimate moments shared through conversation . the well-crafted story is about a special 19th century pistol called " the mexican . " margolese makes it clear that he must possess this valuable item or else . this long separation didn't disappoint me , but it might disappoint some who expected to see a more romantic story develop between the two stars . director gore verbinski ( mouse hunt ) does a nice job tightening up this rambling story when it needed it and keeping the action flowing , though a few of the comedy scenes , such as the one that opens the film , seemed contrived . julia roberts plays a familiar part to her by now , of someone who doesn't have all her smarts , who is very likable when sticking to her work-type characterization of someone trying to get in touch with her feelings through reading self-help books and having conversations about sensitive topics . her chemistry is very good with pitt , but is sensational with gandolfini , as they provide the film with its main stimulus of comedy , rauchiness , violence , and good conversation . all these characters were well-defined and screenwriter j . h . wyman deserves much of the credit for that , as he also embellished the story with excellent dialogue and enough plot twists and surprises to keep crime film buffs guessing at what happens next . while cinematographer dariusz wolski's location shots of the beautiful mountain town of real de catorce were spectacular and made this a very pleasing mainstream film to view . 
zhang yimou ( " raise the red lantern " ) has securely grounded a " feel good " film with characters who have greatly touched me , even though the film is bogged down with much communist propaganda and it ends like a typical hollywood " feel good " movie , in this case with too much good cheer over nothing much accomplished to make it so proud about itself . nevertheless , this is a brilliantly directed austere film for the most part , telling about ordinary people in a very poor , rural village in china's hebei province . it held my interest as i observed the classroom dynamics taking place in a broken down one-room schoolhouse and in the contrasting lifestyle shown in the modern chinese city . these are human interest stories i have not seen before about the new china , presented here in such an informal way . the cast of mostly nonprofessional actors , playing themselves , acquitted their task with a spirited performance , giving power to the story about the problems with rural education for the poor people of that region . the characters should be about the size of a donkey turd . but the mayor will not give her transportation to the city and shrugs his shoulder , saying that's just the way it is with poor people around here . this leads to the only lesson she ever thought , as she has the children do the math for this real-life problem , of trying to figure out how many bricks it would take to move before she has enough for round-trip bus fare . it's a communal effort , since her math is not much better than her student's . this looked so unreal , that i thought the last reel got mixed in with one of those typical hollywood films of this kind . though , what was interesting about this part of the film , was taking a gander at the city and how clean and boring and crowded it looked . the message of the film was unnecessarily delivered in a heavy-handed manner , about the poor conditions of china's rural schools . the film was so adeptly done and looked and felt so good , and the parts of all the people were played by those playing themselves in such a natural way , that i didn't see its downfall coming until it was too late and , anyway , by that time i was really getting off on the film and was amazed by the simple daily life rhythms of the schoolchildren and the common villagers , that i was already hooked on liking the film . i especially found the performance of wei minzhi to be impactful . this fictional story was better than the message delivered , and the film is much better than it sounds , given the aforementioned flaws it has , it still shows the power of human love over all the coldness in the world . 
his most memorable role was in the lodger as jack the ripper , a film that was similar to this one , only presented in a more subtle psychological framework and became recognized as one of the more interesting serial killer films made . warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . cregar gave a nightmarish performance that was staggering and memorable , while linda darnell was alluring as the scheming chanteuse . this is a fast-paced b&w suspense yarn , one that held my attention throughout . it is also noted for its exciting bernard herrmann score whenever the action picks up . 
it's a routine revenge western but , nevertheless , has elements of the quirkiness peckinpah's films will later on become reknown for . this film is visually powerful in spots , as it overcomes its routine theme with burning images of lust , greed , and hatred . maureen sings the film's theme song during the opening and closing credits . 
a good story is infused with too much symbolic pretentiousness , yet the overall effect is absorbing . the film won an academy award for best screenplay and director for john huston , while his father walter huston won for best supporting actor . it was nominated for best film , but lost to hamlet . this black and white film is very well acted , especially by bogie and walter huston , but is not as gripping and intriguing as john huston's masterpiece -- " the maltese falcon . " 
the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion . what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love . 
there are 5 short vignettes where the characters seamlessly intermesh . there are many cogent small observations made which relate to seeing one's self and others as they truly are . the film won a prize at cannes last year , but still is not released to theaters in this country . i saw it on its showtime tv debut . garcia keeps these stories provocative and moving at a fast-pace . this is a smart film that gets amazing characterizations from all the actresses , each giving a wonderfully nuanced performance exhibiting inexplicable and heartfelt emotions . 
robert lord won an oscar for best original screenplay . the director , tay garnett , allowed for satire to carry the comedic load and his instincts were correct , as the film worked , easily overcoming the story's melodramatics . it is interesting to note that kay had a speech impediment , not being able to pronounce r's , therefore the script tried to give her as few of those sounds in her dialogue as possible . this is a breezy story ( believe it or not ! ) skippy : " the fight between you and me when i tell you i can't pay for the drink . " 
a road film about trying to reach somewhere . this human interest drama is one big metaphor about a strained father and daughter relationship . but she gets a flat tire and there's no spare . it's a film that avoids cliches for its answers , has plenty of energy , and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by both lena headey and stellan skarsgard . it is unfashionable to have a mind of your own . " " aberdeen " is thematically similar to mike figgis's " leaving las vegas , " except there the end of the journey was most important , here it is the journey itself that counts the most . 
yes . a war zone can be fun for restless teens with hot blood and a passion for mischief . this is a hearfelt film about his coming-of-age during that strife . the 36-year-old filmmaker studied at ucla and was the cameraman for quentin tarantino's pulp fiction and reservoir dogs . but , as riad says , this is our home , there is no other place i would feel comfortable fitting in . the film is not plot oriented , it relies on a bunch of episodic incidents to take place before tarek gets it through his clownish skull and smirking face that this city has changed and won't be the same again . we get a feel for what the director lived through as the friendly tarek is shown relating to his neighbors . the director also presents us with a flavor of the slang language used by the locals , with expressions such as : " you're shish-kabobing me on a small flame ; " or " you drive like steve mcqueen ; " and , about a buxom woman omar says , " what a piece of lamb ! " the film was good at given us a realistic look at how one family looked at those troubled times , rather than for having anything political to say . we are not getting a history lesson here , but a grown man's look back at a period of eight years of his youthful life . the film did this in a rather ordinary way , so that there is nothing deeper to dig out of ziad doueiri's story . it seemed to be a story that the director had to tell , and he shared what he saw with an audience that more than likely only followed the long civil war in the news stories and had no idea how it looked first-hand . this was a film that had no pretenses about it ; it just told the story it knew . 
this moody minimalist told piece is seen through the lush eyes of the camera rather than told as a narrative . it is about repressed desires and a love affair that never really happens . they realize they are the victims in this marriage but can't act out their repressed feelings , they are too worried about what others might say and do not want to be thought of like their spouses . they seem satisfied to eat out together , almost touch each other , and to just sit together while talking . it shows how well-thought of they both are in their environments , which means so much to them . the film is a visual fashion show of beauty and taste . every shot is stylishly accomplished in a ritualised way . nat " king " cole sings a host of soft ballads that reflect the film's steamy mood , while the couple often get caught walking in a rainstorm , or riding in a cab together , or nearly touching hands , or brushing past each other on the stairs , or expressing through their facial gestures their feelings of love . " do you have a mistress ? " nothing that belongs to it exists anymore . " wong kar-wai ( days of being wild/chungking express/fallen angels ) has created a film about sexual frustration that leaves you hanging on every gesture for a resolution , but this very delicate romance ends without a fulfilling resolution . it is a film that is hard to put out of your mind ; and , a lot of the credit for that should go to the two big stars of hong kong cinema , leung and cheung , who are simply mesmerizing . 
mamet's second effort as a director , after his diabolically successful house of games , is a totally different styled film . it's a mafia black comedy , with undertones of being film noir . the director's witty dialogue and penchant for interesting plot lines are there , but this film is not as sharp-edged as his other work . their gambling venture turns into the weakest part of the film because it is not believable . this is the entertainment highlight of the weekend for them . it also sparks jerry to tell gino not to get too carried away that the girls like them so much , " they always like you when you're someone else . " that's pure mamet dialogue . this scene is brilliantly done , a true pleasure to watch as the men through long drawn-out silences converse without saying much that gives them away . the gestures and the timing of the two is masterful , as the two embrace after much vague conversational banter and recognize each other as equals . there were scenes that lacked weight and seemed phony , but these three main characters gave this film a brilliance in character study : ameche by his brilliantly restrained performance , mantegna by his energetic and funny one , and prosky by his perfectly menacing and touching one . it lifted the film into a rich mixture of farce , gang violence , and tenderness . it's a film that comes with a perfect shoeshine and a perfect smile underneath its ludicrous and cynical premise . 
this italian made western , filmed in spain , began the craze of so-called spaghetti westerns . clint eastwood plays 'the man with no name , ' in the first of the three films made with the same theme ( the others were : " for a few dollars more " ( 65 ) and " the good , the bad , and the ugly " ( 1966 ) ) . the film is a no message one , where violence is glorified by the hero who is as amoral as the villains . this kind of attitude changed the way westerns were made . it's an entertaining film , gore and all , its only drawbacks being the poor dubbing job and that leone hasn't perfected all his moves yet in a smooth way . yet this film , not as rewarding as his others , still has the style of the director's later works , plus the same themes of graphic violence , a laconic hero , and the thrill of gunfights galore . an old bell-ringer tells the newcomer that in this town folks get to be either rich or dead . clint chomps at the end of his cigar without smoking it , says little , wears a mexican poncho , and is always with his trusted . 45s . but this scene was shot in a shoddy way , as it was hard to comprehend that the two gangs were so stupid that they would so easily believe that the stiffs they were fighting over were real . in this western parody , there's some humor behind all the choreographed violence and there's also a passable ennio morricone's score to instill a sense of melodrama . what makes this mythical film noteworthy , is that it serves an historical purpose as the start of a new trend in making westerns . 
it's become a cult-status film , that has staying power as a rather lyrical horror classic . this last incident is the violent note on how the film abruptly ends . the film plays as an allegory , and has a certain strength in its story telling . by the film's end , there's not much difference between the two families as the fight for survival brings everyone down to the level of a beast . i guess that's the point of the film . 
there's a quiet brilliance about this melancholy chamber piece , that is much enhanced by the artistic cinematography of nino gaetano martinetti . it's a film for those who appreciate oddities in filmmaking and are not deterred by the slightness of the story or the slow way it gets to where it's going . 
howard hughes originally entitled it " the man he found , " but on second thought felt the red-menace presented a film with a more modern impact for audiences . despite being shot again , the film still cost the studio only $376 , 000 . warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . for a propaganda film , this one is not bad . it's far superior to other such films on this topic made during the 1950s ( such as the red menace ) . of course , the story of a commie town made up of ex-nazis prospering in the middle of america is hard to swallow , but as sheer entertainment value this one somehow works . it's directed by the very capable auteur , william cameron menzies , the noted art director whose talents greatly enhanced films such as gwtw . 
a solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir , but one that comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind . it's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its dilemma in such a crisp way . what keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by macy who ably anchors the film , as he allows us to see who and what he is ; and , more importantly what suffering he is now going through . sutherland's performance is devilishly demonic , and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a very scary character who gets under our skin . bain's complicity with sutherland adds to the psychological trauma of the macy character . in contrast to the men , neve campbell's performance is loud and reaching . as a character-driven film , it is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced screenwriter henry bromell . panic plays like an episode for homicide does that has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities . bromell , the homicide cop-show writer , has made a tv cop drama come to life as a b movie that can't get away from tv's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics . but , nevertheles , i still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a brain , a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced with bitter irony . 
german-born director dominik moll's second feature , a comic thriller in french , is more like a chabrol than a hitchcock film , though a comparison to hitch's " strangers on a train " is a reasonable one . its theme could be that a comfortable , air-conditioned car , can help solve a lot of domestic problems . this is something that michel doesn't want but harry , who drives a new mercedes , is someone who believes every problem could be solved . even though the boyish looking harry is an affable guy and plum gets along great with the kids , the couple feel uncomfortable with harry . the film's virtues are : the great acting job by lopez , it is accomplished by slowly allowing us to see how really deranged his character is ; the twists in the story that make it hard to guess what comes next , which gives us a bit of a shock at what is taking place as the story carefully builds toward its ironic ending ; plus , there's the attempt to explain why harry's so obsessed with michel , which gives us an intellectual reason to enjoy the film . the film is done with wit and a sense of justifiable psychological chills . it is a frightening tale , but it is done in such a humorous manner that you might not realize how twisted it is until you start making a body count . it's most glaring fault is that it just seems to be too clever for its own good , as we never learn just what harry's motivations are . sometimes a reader reads more into a poem than what was really there ! 
german-born director michael haneke ( " funny games " / " 71 fragments of a chronology of chance " ) continues to make fascinating and diverse films about morality . code unknown is a film marked by its documentary style of filmmaking , as it attempts to look in a realistic way at the immigration of people from all over the world to paris . by using shots with long-takes , the director is able to capture in the facial expressions the various moods that strike his subjects . there's an inherent violence in western europe and there's a mixture of races that can easily be seen in the street scenes , the filmmaker tries to see how a modern european city in the midst of such population changes for its white country handles itself . in this episodic film there are several unconnected stories that seem to be leading nowhere , but are followed through at various points of the film ; the film is devoid of plot and relies on the viewer to make their own observations from what unfolds . this is a brilliantly done art film , offering a detached view of immigration according to the way an outsider sees it . it doesn't come to any grand conclusions , at least none that we haven't seen before , but its way of telling its story holds our interest and should be a rewarding film for those who have an interest in observing things in minute details . it was an excellent idea to have a series of long-takes so we can view the african family in action , the romanian woman dealing with her compatriots back in romania and then desperately sneaking back into paris to try and earn some money , and how the french family is also disengaged by the modern times . there's a sense of loss here , but there's also an excitement about what all this change could stir up . some might see it just as a film -- the way binoche views her actress role in the film within the film , who laughs at it when she sees herself on film . there's a special emotional quality about " code unknown " that allows paris to be seen in its lies . the film convincingly shows how hard it is for different cultures to communicate with others , and even though this has been said before the film's method of getting to that conclusion is the thing to look for here . 
an old-fashioned , above-average heist movie . it covers familiar ground yet manages to make its shopworn story to appear fresh , but does not break new ground in the caper genre . this one , besides having a tight script , has three terrific actors who cover three different generations . the director , frank oz ( " bowfinger " ) , a onetime muppeteer whose main body of work has been comedy , deserves credit for keeping the action suspenseful and the long scenes without dialogue interesting . there seemed to always be something intriguing going on . most of the thrills come by way of the heist and the mechanics of it , and the possibilty of double-crosses and foul-ups . " the score " does what it sets out to do , which makes it a diverting heist flick . it leaves no messages and no unnecessary violence , but it holds one's attention for the two hours it plays and afterwards you will remember this one as a pretty good heist flick that had three notable actors in it who performed the proper nuances called for by the script . the film proves to be a solid effort , but it lacks the imagination and moody darkness of the human spirit to take it to a melville level in noir caper flicks . everyone in on the caper could have been in on a venture capital deal just as easily as on a heist , which makes their characters only superficially appealing . 
warning : spoiler in next paragraph . what ray does very well is make this into a love story , one that is movingly real as it is not corny or filled with clich ? s . the dark , expressionist photography and the love between these two in such dark settings gives this very ordinary story a poetical elegance and makes it a memorable film . 
an invigorating charlie chan escapade and the best one in the series , featuring sidney toler as chan . the film reaches its climax after several plot twists when there's a challenge between rhadini and zodiac , which charlie asks lewis's paper to sponsor . this wasn't a tough one to figure out who did it , but the story was a seamless one . it was a fun film , and one also got a chance to see the san francisco version of the 1939 world's fair . 
a very entertaining charlie chan episode , though the way charlie gets the killer seems far-fetched and the killer's reason had to be explained by charlie because nothing in the film would indicate his reason . this film had a good circus atmosphere , lots of charm to it , and the suspects did a good job of looking guilty . 
the studio heads of 20th century fox were most pleased with the appealing toler , as the film proved to be a box-office success . the film emphasized the goofiness of the characters more than paying attention to the detective story , but the warm feeling the story had was very satisfying . by the end the film successfully combines the zany comic antics with an exciting detective yarn , though purists of this series might not be that appreciative of all the comedy antics biting into the suspense . 
a very good chan film . it has a spooky atmosphere , a lot of plot twists , a fast-pace , and is fun to watch . there are many characters ( though there are too many to develop anything about them ) , many suspects , and there is a daffiness about this episode that is endearing . if you disregard all the holes in the story , then you should find this one to be a refreshing thriller . 
the story unfolds like a routine charlie chan mystery , except the plot is well-executed . a solid action episode , featuring a chase through the paris sewers . 
this is the film noir that made alan ladd a hot star after many years as a struggling actor . it helped that they were both short and photographed well together . the film's terse dialogue , atmospheric dark shots in the freight yards and the snappy presentation of a very slight story when added on to alan ladd's menacing and laconic performance , made this a solid example of what film noir is supposed to be like . it helped establish a number of conventions and character types for this genre . 
it is mixed messages like that from ford that have always made me wary of him , and despite how layered in complexity the plot and character development this western is and how tight frank nugent's rich script is in pointing out traditional army customs for those who gave their lives in defending america's frontiers--it is still a film that loves war and finds killing to be necessary . these social rituals seem to be just as important as learning how to shoot a rifle . the film also has a half-baked romance that was not only dull , but made the film feel longer than it should have . as in all ford westerns , there are his stock characters and scenes devoted to comic humor about the irish being heavy drinkers and gallant fighters . 
the film is crowded with at least thirty characters trying to tell their urban horror story . the film also handles a love story , as this bleak look at inner-city life puts everyone's feet to the hot coals . this ambitious painting of a desperate city and its fragile people , often makes salient points and just as often leaves us overhearing conversations without going further with the story . it varies from being like a soap opera to at times offering some very touching dramatic moments . it's a big , messy , angry film , that is both powerful and sad . and like everything in america , it's ultimately about black and white relationships . the film offers observations and not answers . as for its dramatics , i found the romance between spano and williams to be very believable and moving . also , the relationship between spano and lo bianco seemed to sum up the film . it's difficult to say what sayles thinks , as he seems to want to leave that up to the viewer . 
the film is marvelously acted by anjelica huston , who received an oscar nomination for best actress . it also has a tight script by donald e . westlake . it's a film that doesn't leave you with much to think about afterwards , but while it played its grit and pulp qualities shine in the darkness . the film could have been better served with a more spirited actress than bening , who's best asset is her body . while cusack seemed to not fit what a noir character should be like , as he seemed to be more like a guy who was just trying to be a good grifter . he looked like he would have fit more into a sports film than this one . but the film still works as a modern film noir vehicle , as the script didn't have depth but it provided a full blast of cynicism and shocks that played into the dark plot rather well . if it's a dark , sleazy film , that is well-crafted that you are in the mood for , then this one should be right up your alley . 
there is a sense of doom that all the main characters share , as they also share a sense of mixing violence with sex . lewis has created a nasty film noir , where all the characters are sullied by their peculiar sexual habits . conte is convincing as the maniacal hood , while wilde is a good counter-balance to conte . the film was raw , a visually unblemished drama about violence and pain . 
french director eric rohmer's third film is a coming-of-age story , comically looking at the human condition . the beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves and how tense it gets when love and desire become the main topics that are burning in these very ordinary characters' minds . rohmer is making sport of the adults and how phony they are . the only one who talks with a straight tongue is pauline . the charm in the story is how after all the gossip and lies and perversions pauline sees , she grows up that summer and sees through all the deceits of the adults . rohmer does it without a strong plot but by his ability to have the characters play out who they are in a realistic way , letting their words and actions become examples of how they really are . only pauline comes through this vacation with a worthwhile summer romance . the pleasure in the film is in its simplicity , even if it is not that deep of a story . the natural way it was filmed makes it a pleasant viewing experience , probably reminding the viewer of some similar experience they might have had on the beach . 
it's a slow-moving visual piece , setting a bleak moody atmosphere as it touches on voyeurism and misplaced love and obsessions and childhood abuse . the film's title comes from an elvis costello song of the same name . this ill-fated relationship comes to a sudden tragic culmination , which gives power to all the visual images leading up to this surprising climax . he's so obsessed that he can't make love to the more than willing smokey , as he burns inside from anger and alienation and frustration . but the story is too slight to make much inroads into those deep emotional directions , except the power in the film comes from the aftershocks that set in long after viewing the film . it mainly holds one's interest because the story is so oddly told and all the characters seem to have dark sides ready to burst open at any time . when they do , it seems to make sense . its best feature comes by way of polish cinematographer slawomir idziak , who uses his noted method of filtered filming to great advantage here to capture the angst of the characters and their dark love life . 
a very solid crime thriller shot in semi-documentary style . its story is of the formulaic kind , but because it was so smoothly executed and the pace was so fluid the episodic saga had a natural flow to it . under the very able direction of joseph h . lewis , the action scenes are brought about with the tension always building . because of the film's dark mood it sets and that the killers can't be linked with their violent crimes , the film has the feel of noir . 
the story might be slight , but the acting by tritignant is just right and the action scenes keep coming and are perfectly executed . scheider also stands out in a supporting role . this flick is all about shootouts and quirky character portrayals , like the one of the housewife talking nonstop to the press about her ordeal and eating up the fact that she's on tv . 
a more conventional and not as absorbing remake of mystery of the wax museum , 1933 , made with the gimmick of 3-d ( used in a fun way with novelty shots of a barker batting paddleballs in your face and a murderer jumping seemingly out at the audience ) . it also effectively used the special warner color process . strangely enough , the film's director , andr ? de toth , lost the sight of one eye and therefore couldn't appreciate the effects of 3-d since he had no depth perception . this is also the film where vincent price made his mark as a villain figure in horror films and was typecast forever in that role . he wanted to make the museum more commercial by displaying a chamber of horrors , but jarrod is only interested in creating real-life beauty from historical figures such as marie antoinette and joan of arc . it was a decent enough horror film , as seen in this cable tv version of regular 2-d , but it lacked more sparks to it . it seemed to languor at points of its story , and its grand guignol characterization was too often wasted by touristy tours of the museum . they were interesting , but didn't add much to the story . all the creepiness comes from price and igor . 
a tense melodrama about a crippled p . o . w , it was a taut , suspenseful story , ruined somewhat by the cop-out ending . it's still a superior film noir , with a meaningful social conscience theme . the grimness of this tale is certainly something the director understood , and for most of the film that shows . the mood of the film is best captured in the capable hands of bob surtees' eloquent black and white photography . 
a great low-budget heist film noir . perennial losers in filmdom , elisha cook , jr . and stafford repp , fit right in to this plot . it made for a very entertaining film . 
a messenger gives andrews a note marked very important , but when opened it is of trivial concern . it concludes with an action-packed finale , which is not usually the case for the more cerebral way charlie solves his cases . but there's the usual twist in plot to catch you by surprise as to who the gang leader is . it made for a very entertaining film , a solid charlie chan vehicle even though there's less detective work done in this chan episode than in others . 
it was a well-executed , action-packed film noir , co-directed and acted by edmond o'brien . 
an atmospheric , thrilling whodunit , that is full of surprises , is fast-paced , and is well-acted . but the case puzzles him as all the clues so easily point to brent , it's as if the ex-con has been framed . 
this worked , making for a crafty production , mainly because it left much of the horror scenes to the viewer's imagination . hammer studio also exploited the x rating it received , which meant only those over 18 could attend , as it launched a massive ad campaign which brought in the crowds to find out why such a rating and also by making the x part of the film's title--the quatermass xperiment , it kept the public's attention on its ad campaign . yet the monster remains a sympathetic figure . it was an easy film to watch , as it had its creative moments in the dark . it offered better entertainment value than most big-budget sci-fi films . 
this solid western was the only film roy huggins ever directed , as he went on to do tv work creating the maverick series and later on the rockford files . they fear the union's reaction , as they don't expect justice if they surrender . the tense film becomes a character study in bravery , cowardice , innocence , greed , and romance . it was as if a weight were lifted from their shoulders . the film is made potent be scott's austere presence and the dry wit that runs through the script . this results in a very lively film , but also one that is slightly offbeat . 
a top-notch adventure yarn that criss-crosses the globe in the mid-1930s . a solid film that's high on entertainment value , even though it's a conventional work . 
it's not clear which man she's with , but neither shows much interest in her . the marriage has been a strained one , without much affection or love on liz' part for fred . the film has an intangible intensity about it that elevates its melodramatic story and makes all the main characters hopeless victims of their circumstances that they can't change . 
this is her favorite role in her personal favorite movie . he instigated this move she wasn't that crazy about , but went along with it the best way she could . sigourney mentioned that this is an unusual and uplifting film , though the unusual nature of the film is easy to see , as this gritty dramatic film takes a conventional soap opera story about a nuclear family and makes it into a moving drama where the characters are forced to look at themselves again and undergo changes they didn't expect . the uplifting part was harder to see and just might be up to the individual to find what is meant by uplifting . it was a difficult film to come up with easy answers , as it required some thought to sift through the many layers of the characters . there's also the constant noise and lack of privacy to deal with . unfortunately there was one scene that was baked over too fine : that would be the jail scene with alice eventually winning over the hardened cons . it seemed contrived and the film spent too much prison time , as it said everything it had to say about the dehumanizing effect jail has in its opening shot when she was booked and everything else seemed reduntant . also , the last scene felt flat . i find it hard to believe that was an uplifting scene as much as it was one that put an exclamation point on the situation , visually indicating that things are still tenuous for the family and even though they have gone over one terrible hurdle and are perhaps psychologically stronger because of it--they are still not out of the dark . but , then again , if you find that uplifting you'll get no argument from me . the film is directed by scott elliott , making his film debut after being known for his broadway work and as the artistic director of the new group ; the film is more ambiguous than pat , which is not necessarily a bad thing . elliott also does a great job of drawing out an outstanding performance from sigourney weaver . it was a part that should have been expanded and it weakened the film by instead padding it with stale prison and courtroom scenes that many films have done before . nevertheless , this is still a high quality drama , especially recognizing sigourney weaver's tour de force performance of a complex woman who is a little off-kilter . that should be rewarding enough for those who crave intelligent 'mom in trouble' dramas . i unhestatingly recommend the film for the way it intelligently examines the family crisis--though it's not for everyone , as the casual viewer might not be interested in a serious film that can be disturbing when a toddler is taken off a respirator . the film played at the williamstown film festival . 
it's a theme that's been done often , but in this very witty and bitter-sweet comedy the characters are truly endearing and funny . mira sorvino was in the same acting class as laura and read the script . the film was shot on a digital camera . he performs in his underwear and gives a shrill performance that is bound to turn everyone off ; the filmmaker manages to get in a dig at newspaper theater critics and their supposed good taste , by having one of them give it a rave review . what makes the two leads hilarious , is that they are ambitious to the point of being narrow-minded and are humorless about their situation . she was also very funny auditioning for an advil spot which she doesn't get , as behind the humor it shows how being rejected is part of the business but it is very difficult not to take it as something personal . the film does a savage job dissecting the thirst there is for fame , in a storyline that is very much new yorkish in attitude and spirit . it might not be all new material and the characters do grow somewhat weary after a fast start but , all things considered , it was surprisingly a lot of fun . the two are still unemployed and are contemplating any offers for a tv series . 
this was a revolution the director was a supporter of , but has now gotten into trouble with the censors because of his film's contents . the film was unique , honest , raw , and daring . makhmalbaf shows a great passion for dealing with the ironies of modern iran . 
dennis schwartz " movie reviews and poetry " whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up , as the director stated it is , is unimportant ; the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months , featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves , concerned with getting older and still being single . their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical . that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with , does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told , one that has many implications on our culture , relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world . the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama , a " rear window " for singles . this time it is not a crime that we see , but is a voyeurist's delight , and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home , as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldn't see . but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film , which is really not a documentary , except in its style . this could be a personal ad about her , if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love ( she can have sex whenever she wants to ) , but for monetary reasons . michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four , except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals . he is serious , stable , and straightforward , and sounds a lot like what women want in guy , but he says that is what they say they want , but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly , going after them just for the sex . he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be . though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him , especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt , which in his lingo , is an ugly dog , by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave . this film might be upsetting to some , but it is a fresh look at an old problem , and its aim is readily accomplished , as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary . 
a brilliant , witty mock documentary of jean seberg , that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of , but did not actually say , these are mark rappaport's words . she was to appear in many films afterward , but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about , lilith . this film challenges our credibility , it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times , telling us secrets that may or may not be true . it also enlightens us that seberg's stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that time , but is now acceptable , making her a trend setter . this is a clever film , immensely satisfying and enjoyable ; and , fortunately , the director casts jean in a favorable light , she seems to deserve that . 
happiness is not a film about happiness , because happiness is not real but imagined , therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state . so goes the theme of this dark comedy , meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with , in a film that features a pedophile rapist ( dylan ) , a murderer ( camyrn ) , an obscene caller ( hoffman ) , a masturbator ( read ) , a russian immigrant thief ( jared ) , and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos , as solondz's morbid sense of humor turns to new jersey's suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race . this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it ( solondz refused the studio's offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as , william hurt , because he felt dylan was just right for the role ) . this film is meant for an art house type of audience , one that is able , as difficult as it may be , to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen . i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it , that would just defeat its purpose . the audience i saw this film with , were mostly williams college students and faculty , and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it , where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and , in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story , he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters . the laughter was appropriate , and even " hip , " as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies , and it didn't seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked , causing people to react as a group rather than individually . i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent ; and , there was at no time just one person alone laughing ( but , the best part , is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed ) . happiness is a difficult picture to watch , there are no good guys or gals . the sisters all suffer from ego-centredness , and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has , as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves . this is a very solid film , that is well-acted , that is understandably not for everyone , yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu , and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line , this is still a powerful film , one deserving of attention and intelligent critique , one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art , even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told . many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films . that is not the case with this film , obviously . this film leaves you little choice , you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is , or you can ignore it , or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for , and therefore come to hate it . i came close to loving it , while not exactly loving it , mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages . but close to loving it , means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character . i did , however , think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
writer-director/acting star-artist , takashi kitano , has broken ground from traditional films , taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film , that sways between the two extremes , and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states , fireworks is a cross between ozu's late spring and don siegel's dirty harry . kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women . his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography . one should expect the unexpected from his films . the violence is brutal and fast-paced . the narrative is told in flashbacks , so any part of nishi's life could pop up on the screen , and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding , deceptively turns out to be much more than that , even as nishi gets revenge on the yakuma's who did this to his friend , unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen . you better believe that caught my attention . but , if that was all this film was about , the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos . this highly original film , that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b- movie , is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture , but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity , while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian , even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries . as far as i am concerned , i prefer ozu , i am more taken with his intellect and perspective , but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to , as i found this volatile film to be something special , but something i can't completely comprehend because i don't really know what he is trying to say , as if that really matters . yet his film is a visual treat to behold , and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work . 
this powerhouse of a film is geared to get under your skin and is not , as most hollywood films are , made to amuse you and cater to your idea of what a romantic film is supposed to be . labute's debut film is hard to describe , though the plot is simple enough , but this is not a film that depends on plot for it to be understood . that what comes out of these conversations , to say the least , is disdainful , but that is not the point labute is trying to make , nor does he use these talks solely for shock value . what is taking place is more real than that , and much more frightening . playwright labute uses words that are meant to be spiteful and piercing to one's fragile ego . the scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way , as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have , and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance . but the point of the story is , that their life is absurd , so why not get what you want , no matter what you have to do to get it ) . at least , we have the feeling that aaron understands this . the movie is not driven by plot , so what unfolds is somewhat unconventional for movie lore ( though not for the world of plays , from where the director draws his strength ( ala mamet ) , which has a much richer history of misogynistic characters being the ones you love to hate ) . what is here unpleasant and shameful and immoral , is played out to the hilt with all the traumas one could expect . i must respectfully say , this film has balls . no matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be , it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level . i think that is because we have all questioned our relationships at one time or another and felt a certain vulnerability , and wonder about how that other person now feels , the one who did harm to us , how is he or she getting on . this film does that to us ; it provokes us to look at things that are unpleasant in our lives . we realize that aaron wins because he is a charmer , but those not taken in by sharing his deceits would not be taken in by his charm . but we are not really comfortable with aaron's aggressiveness , and out first reaction , is to recoil from him in horror when seeing him so depicted on screen . but i wonder how many aaron-types we have met in real-life and didn't recoil from . and his lies , are the kind that those without a true sense of themselves tell ; while , the matts' of this world are the humorless types you might have had a morning coffee with and felt you were with someone you didn't quite like but didn't know why , as they seemed nice enough in the office ambiance , but you know instinctively that you can't trust them , that they will harm you if they can , that they just can't help being the worms they are . stacy is the only one in the film that we are supposed to feel for . the three stars are all excellent in convincing us of who they are in the film . stacy's role might seem to be the most difficult one to pull off , because of her portrayal of deafness and vulnerability , and being " the female " in the film . this is not a flawless picture , but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with one's more tender feminine side . it is able to captivate us , because its words have power . 
the plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be , and how death-like is the atmosphere they work in , and how frighteningly transient everything seems to be . that society can be repressive and authoritarian , is still true today , as this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed after all the women's lib movement agendas and all the other changes in the workplace that have been accomplished , especially for women , and if these changes have really made life better for them . a gem of a small movie . . . adeptly uncovering the need for positive relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace , which might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world . and even though , no smug answers were given as how to accomplish this , one does have choices ; at least , you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation , and not just marking time and staying put on a job that bores you . this movie definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about , and even if it said it in a low voice , its message can be heard above the idle chatter in the office , if you are tuned in to the right cubicle . 
this is raimi's attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder . this wintry morality tale , its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of fargo , without the comedy , as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience , but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life . billy bob is particularly outstanding in his true-to-life characterization of such an individual . but as a result , her interference makes things worse . this is a dilemma for the filmmakers , there seems to be something devoid about this tale that can't surface , except in outwardly visual terms , as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white . there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane , as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film's morality play . the result of all the trio's bungling , is that things are no longer simple for them , as greed and their extended version of the american dream , but this time earned the too easy way , via a suitcase full of money found in the snow , becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility , as all their character flaws become magnified , and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found . this is a strong gut-wrenching suspense film , one of the top ten of 1998 . but the film is just lacking something , and i think that thing it needed , was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychological/spiritual keel and not descend into a literal biblical morality theme . raimi did a superb visual job , carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains , a difficult task to do , but one that he succeeds in without question . my feeling is , that in due time , we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many , as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics . 
an autobiographical film of hou hsiao hsien , grounded in the history of taiwan from 1947 through the 1950s and the early 1960s . this was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow , not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes , but because i didn't have a full knowledge of what taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame , therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events , didn't always connect with me , as well as it should have . i could only watch the film from the point of view of what i got from the film itself . and , that is , the story of a family , trying to cope with their own secrets and their own idiosyncrasies , that proves to be a very human tale , something along the lines of an ozu film . but he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children , enjoying a rich childhood , growing up with many pleasant memories . the film is shot through the point of view of ah-ha . what is beautiful about the film is its lushness , the sunny colors it evokes , giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise , and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to , like the softness of the rain falling , his father sitting so nobly by his desk , grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is . this is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts childhood in a very simple but relevant manner , that only a very few filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental way . this is a work of considerable merit . review on 2/2/99 
given the context of the material for this pulp thriller , it is surprising that this english speaking chabrol film , set in st . tropez , is as diverting and suspenseful as it is . credit must be given to an ingenious script , and acting kudos , especially for romy , jean , fran ? ois , and pierre , for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the twists in the ever changing plot . chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before , to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle , to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship , and how money is such a psychological part of one's mindset . mr . l ? gal is a pip , a pleasure to see on screen ; a character nonpareil , played to perfection , someone who , despite his small part , you will remember long after seeing the film . but if you think you got where the story is going now , you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way , because chabrol is going to town with this thriller , twisting and turning at the movement of every julie sexy wiggle . the outcome is a satisfying one , though if you start to think of what occurred , of relationships changing every reel , of those dead , not being dead , you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off all the switches . but by having the police using their power of deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully as they can , it all adds punch to the pulp story , so even if you are aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the imagination a little too much , that maybe the story did get a little too cute , as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the story would hold up to further scrutiny ; nevertheless , it is more fun to let the story pass as it is , and enjoy it for what it is , as jeff turns up alive , and the situation must get resolved again , as julie is now in a position to choose between the new louis , now able to service her properly , and the dashingly irresistible jeff . what an enjoyable film this is ! so much is thrown into the mix , if you don't like one twist in the story there is another to soon come , as the cold-hearted bitchy sexpot julie becomes more important to the men than the money or their state of well-being . chabrol even gives the justice system a well-deserved scolding , saying the reason for the vagaries in justice existing as it does for women , is because the law was created by men for men . the film begins in irony and ends in irony , even though everything about the characters involved has changed . even the police seem a little smarter for their effort . 
kitano , the director and star of this gangster actioner , has created a visually stunning , original and spellbinding depiction of stylized gang fights , ambushes , and assorted mayhem . kitano the actor , keeps an impassive facial expression throughout the movie , as he toys with his guns at play and for real , in a performance that wavers between a sensibility and an insensibility toward life , as violence though not glorified , nevertheless is what is fascinatingly portrayed by his unwillingness , in the end , to be perceived any other way . the great images on screen is the star of this film , not the acting , nor the story line , both pale next to the splendid visualizations kitano creates . the japanese audiences rebuked him for his critique of their social conformity ; and , thusly , his movie appeal is mostly with foreign audiences . here the film gets playful and unpredictable , as kitano has his men shed their tough guy personas and play like the children they really are . the narrative fades in importance , and the sheer poetry of the moment is caught on screen , giving us the impression that this is the first time in a long while he is enjoying being who he is . you can blindly fall in love with a film like this for its originality and forcefulness , as it allows you to look at brutality without having to offer the usual rational responses for its place in the film . the last reel of the film is somewhat of a meditation on death and suicide . it brings up all kinds of hidden emotions in kitano , and is miles apart from any other type of film of this particular genre . by taking the time needed to explore the inner workings of his character , kitano has taken the gangster role and made it more intellectually spicy than it usually is for such violent films . and , even though , there is shown a lot of the usual reactions gangsters have when they are double-crossed , such as revenge , the film somehow is trying to say more than that , but what that is , is hard to say , because it is the visual effects that are what splendidly override everything else about this film , as there are moments of gore interrupted by welcomed moments of dreamlike serenity , all done with magical camera work , probably , hiding the fact , that the film had nothing really to say other than the pretty picture it paints on screen , since whenever it had a chance to say something , kitano was mute . but it was done so stylishly well , that it was , indeed , intriguing to behold , leaving the viewer with much doubt about who kitano really is supposed to be , aside from his hubris as a gangster , and , his mixed outbursts of violent outward behavior and contemplative inner mood swings . 
this film will evoke memories of films such as chinatown and the bad and the beautiful , and of the starlets of that era , lana turner , veronica lake , and rita hayworth . the feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the hollywood glamorous life of that period , at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous , while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work hand-in-hand with the cops , hoping to catch a hollywood figure with narcotics , or in bed with someone who they shouldn't be with , or get the goods on some commies in hollywood . there are so many wonderful performances , that it is difficult to say which one is the best , but the russell crowe , dumb tough guy , muscle man cop , takes the cake as far as i am concerned , it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across , as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing , as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information . and believe it or not , these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick . cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief , with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop , who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you . his role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the l . a . police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry , even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation . the film is long , but it moves at a very brisk pace , covering a multitude of sub-plots . the most disturbing thing about the movie , might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesn't work , anyway , and that if the criminal element gets pounded on , then , so what , they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops . maybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude , or maybe this film is just pure entertainment . but the film loaded the deck for any other argument , and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens , even if it is an exceptionally well-made , cynically humorous , and terrifically acted picture ; but , yet , it might not be as great as it appears , since its subliminal message is that you can't change the system . 
but for most of the film , it is through wade's narrow focus that we see what is taking place . this is another russell banks novel based film that has been well-suited for the big screen ( a recent one was the more personally meditative , the sweet hereafter ) . because we see the accident through wade's neurotic eyes we are never quite sure what it is we have seen , but by the time the movie winds down and wade unravels , we see how pervasive corruption is in this economically depressed town , and we hope that wade can move in that direction to get the guilty culprits instead of chasing something he might have imagined . but since this story is mostly a psychological thriller , we are caught in the web of nolte's very compelling characterization , as he is someone who puts us into his shoes , so that we can't help seeing what a tormented person he is , and are really unsure for the time being whether a crime was committed or not , until by the film's end , then everything seems to come into place , and we realize how far gone wade has become . nolte is so good in this role , that we can actually feel wade's traumas reverberating within us . his iconoclastic and memorable portrayal of an abusive father , is very hard- hitting and original . these characterizations made the bleakness of the story delightfully credible and penetrating . living in a small new england town myself , i can attest to how uncannily realistic the town and the people in it appeared to be . schrader ( the director of taxi driver ) is so uniquely suited to do this type of film , as he makes the most of this absorbing look into these troubled men' psyches , holding up a mirror of truth , to see if it is still possible for those who are so troubled to see themselves in someone else and to astutely ascertain what it is they are doing to themselves . creating a portrait of how a dysfunctional family is , without being trite about it , is not that easy to accomplish , especially since this kind of subject matter is old news by now . but this film accomplished that by creating an edgy mood piece , that has to be watched carefully , because it is filled with plenty of jewels for those who are willing to dig them out in the dark spaces they are to be found in , where one man's plight becomes something that can be so universally felt . 
so what if the great danish director , carl theodor dreyer's screenplay , written with preben thomsen in the mid-60s , is not adhered to , so be it ! right ! i'm talking about him saying that he communed with the spirits of dreyer and those spirits approved of what he is doing to change the film . i just can't get caught up in that nonsense , for me , it's what i see on screen that counts . it does not matter how others filmed it or would have filmed it , whether it is pasolini's most interesting 1969 version of it , starring maria callas or von trier's take on it , that is the better one . and even though both pasolini and von trier are gifted filmmakers , with pasolini , in my opinion , being the more poetical and imaginative of the two , nevertheless , dreyer is still the master , and i would have expected more from him than i do from the others , though i am pleased to say , i am sated by both these differing versions of medea , but in differing ways . vision and intensity are certainly important elements in a film , and that is what is the driving force behind this film , based on euripides' tragedy , that was made for danish tv . this tale of medea is still a living myth , one that every generation should come to its own terms with , and that is precisely what trier has attempted to do . knowing the story doesn't necessarily preclude that we can feel the story . whatever opinion you might have about von trier's telling of the myth , you can agree that his version of it , is definetly a deeply felt emotional experience , one that went to the heart of the matter in terms of feeling the agony of what a woman who has lost touch with herself because of her pride , is going through . by emphasizing her feelings as being only for herself , her irrationality is made rational , even if it isn't rational . through her fall from grace , we see the tragedy unfold , and the deadly consequences of her jealousy and sense of being wronged come around to its bitter fruition . the dialogue is sparse . the open air scenery is intense , it appeared to me as if i was looking at van gogh's wheatfields , with the wind swirling forcefully in and out of the fields . and this tale is all the more a tragedy . . . the only difference is that from dreyer's style of simplicity in filmmaking , we can feel the pains ourself , we didn't need it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements . that he succeeds in this film , is certainly evident . he succeeds because he has found the right medea for the part , and has caught enough of the mood without ruining it as he almost does , by going overboard with his excesses . i am mainly referring to the hanging scenes of the children . he came very close to turning me off , as i was beginning to suspect that these scenes didn't have to be that explicit in all its morbid details , the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one , seemed to me , to be exploitive and incredulous , as well as unnecessary . all we had to see was the pained expression on medea and the children and we could have drawn our own visions , even more powerful ones than the ones we materially witnessed . the reason dreyer is a master and one of the greatest directors ever , is because he did not compromise his integrity or the film's integrity going after anything that was superfluous to the telling of the story . i always get the feeling when i am seeing a dreyer film , i am seeing something that is truly visionary . yet when i see a von trier film , i can't say the same , even though he is a very talented director , i just can't trust his judgment when it comes to telling the story without it seeming to be pretentious . i am never sure if he really got it or if he is putting me on . 
whale , always the aesthete and snob , comments to an interviewer that he just directed the first two frankensteins , the others were done by hacks . what highlights this film and makes it propelled on a high octane level , is the bravura physical performance of ian mckellen , whose presence on screen is gigantic as a swish personality , much like a few other great performances accomplished recently about gifted artistic and intellectual english queers , such as derek jacobi as francis bacon in love is the devil and john hurt's performance of a fictionalized stuffy professor in love and death on long island . she is wonderfully dour in her supporting role . if it is fear or disgust of homosexuals that repels you , this film will displease you , even though its overt physical sex is minimalized , yet every nuance of the film and all its projections are about what a queer is like . this scene turns out to be a classically hilarious comedy routine , probably capturing whale's devilish personality as well or better than the more dramatic scenes did . clayton is anything but literary , never even having heard of whale before , just as whale is hardly your prototypical fatherly figure . but whale opens up with clayton and becomes nostalgic about his life and his films , more so than with the film student who really knew his films , but was just perceived by whale as a user of people . it seems that there was probably some deeply repressed psychological need in whale to be accepted by certain types of people , which is why he devotes so much time to the uninspiring clayton , it was as if he needed to have his approval to be gay . what is most impressive and understated about the film , is the comic tone and lightness of whale , much like the tone whale used in his horror films , which he used to hide the real fear of death people have and their antagonism for monsters , whom whale simply adored and would never make fun of . he comes across as debonair at all times , even when in the middle of a mild stroke , and terribly witty in the ways of hollywood's gays . reactions to whale , as to whether you care for him or not , come about from how the participants in his life view his films , which we see them watch on tv . clayton must somehow see something in them that affects him greatly , since he alone of the housekeeper and his ex-girlfriend , see's something endearing in those films , yet he is turned off by whale's homosexuality , but he still poses for him , and that only seems to be because he wants something more than the money he is being paid to pose , he wants something from him that he is not quite sure that he can articulate . perhaps , both are drawn to each other because they don't travel in the same circles and can relax with each other since no false representations of themselves are really needed . for all its wonderful performances and charm and probative look into the gay hollywood world , this is not a very important film , in the sense that it has little to say about the creative experience but a lot to say about how a queer man can manuever his way around the hollywood of the past , as long as he didn't make a big show out of his sexual predilections . condon has very ably directed a likable and witty film on a very low budget , that makes its subject seem much greater than it is , it is as if jimmy whale invited us over for some iced tea and cucumber sandwiches and he told us a few things about himself and the filming of his frankenstein movie before he got tired-and-all , so all we had left to ponder was the materialism and memories he was surrounded by , and how tired and painful life has become for him , as he wishes for a mercy killing at the hands of clayton , but since he couldn't bring that about , he instead jumps into his pool of seduction and drowns himself . it is apparent that whale has this tremendous identification with outcasts ( monsters ) , therefore it seems logical to deduce , that for those who liked this film , it really came down to what they saw in it how well they responded to it , just as when clayton saw the frankenstein movie on tv for the first time with betty , and gravitated toward the film , while betty saw it as passe , something that wasn't cool enough for her to enjoy . 
i dunno , maybe his head came loose . is there a connection between the flayer and the birds ? this is real funny stuff . the special effects for this low-budget film are surprising well-done . i loved the explanation given for what god is : an invisible force we fear , and in our vanity , we try to make it human . sometimes the low-budget nonsense films that don't take themselves that serious and just go out there and do their funny thing , are much better than those serious films that win all those critical praises from the illustrious establishment critics , and this is one of those films , in the genre of someone like an edgar ulmer . all you have to remember about this film , is that what you have seen , is all that there is to see , there are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings for you to ponder . 
this one has a reflective mood and a quiet sparseness to it , that gives its lonely characters a chance to either grow as the story develops or for them to become clearer about who they are and what they are doing . las vegas can arguably be , america's alter-ego , even if , that city is a sharp contrast to what the rest of the country is like . but it does offer a lure for foreign and american visitors to see how the free wheeling , capitalist country , they imagine america to be , operates , when it lets its puritanical hair down . how to do it smartly , with class . while , melville's film , retains an almost unbelievable lightness to it . it gives me great delight to see the casino get ripped off , as john works his $150 into $2 , 000 worth of credit and a free room and amenities . i wonder if this scam really works ! ! ! the acting is more than credible , it is superb , as it is just right for the atmosphere it sets . the sparse dialogue helps give the story an intensity that is riveting , giving off the impression that there is something deeper happening than there is . the characters make this film happen . it is a good first effort by the director , who has told a tight story and told it well , holding our interest with a fresh approach to an old story . 
the film does a marvelous job of giving us a feel about life in the early part of the 20th century and how resolute some genuine seekers of the truth were in carrying on the arguments of religious orthodoxy versus scientific reality . since he can't find anything phony about these photos , he is pressed into believing that maybe it is possible to prove that there is a spiritual world with such creatures in attendance . his tendency is to believe that faith is what we must live by : " i don't need proof , faith is enough for me . " one of the problems with the film , that took away some of its luster , was that charles acted in such a one dimensional manner , jumping from non-believer to a firm believer in fairies in such a rapid time , that it was hard to fathom what was going on in his head . therefore his story did not have the impact it could have had with a more drawn out response and introspective performance . he was not someone that we could warm up to in an instant without knowing more about him than his tragic loss . now kingsley's role is really structured to fit a rigid character who can't change , yet his presence on screen is dynamic , bringing much more to his villainous role than just that one dimension to it . we might not like him but we have a better understanding of him than we do of charles . wanted to like charles much more than we were given a chance to and we couldn't , mainly because we could never get close enough to him . but that is not to say his performance wasn't good . it was well-suited according to character , but it was not a stirring performance and not one that completely captured our imagination . what results is a film that is beautifully photographed and stimulating to the intellect and freshly innovative . and , for how many films can you say all that is true ? we are led to believe that religion doesn't work because it is too fearful to go inward ; that theosophy doesn't work because it is not a real experience for those partaking in their seances and pseudo-scientific experiments ; and , that science doesn't work because its knowledge is limited . but the love story remains secondary to the ideas presented about the afterworld ; her romantic interest in him just never becomes vital to the story . where the story is strongest and most convincing , is when it tries to debunk both the belief and disbelief in fairies . there is no rational argument he can present to edify what he knows for certain . this is a very intelligent and effective film , that raises many interesting ideas and questions about the supernatural . it is a serious film , that should be seen by an audience that is not afraid of a story with an unhappy ending ; it offers a fresh outlook to a meaningful experience about the afterworld . this topic has been virtually taboo in our culture ever since the '60s drug revolution imploded on the landscape and caused a generational war . but it is now the end of the century , and the questions alluding to a spiritual world and the use of psychedelics as one way to get there , are more relevant than ever . if there are quibbles with this imperfect film , they are not that significant when you consider how well it made its case about an afterworld . this is something western mystics might find easier to believe than others ; but , in any case , one seeking the truth still must choose which spiritual conditions to aspire to , and this film presents one such option . that this mysterious story was so captivating , showing how necessary it was for charles to find his place there and how believable his quest was , speaks highly of how well this film was crafted by the director . 
homegrown is a lovable off-the-wall film that , probably , very few people have seen or even heard about . that might be because the film goes off on so many different directions-- from murder to counter-culture romance-- before it zeroes into the hippy drug dealing scene as it evolved from the '60s to what it is today , which makes it a too controversial topic for sony to know how to advertise and release to theaters . this is a film that you will probably only get a chance to see on cable or video . its highly animated story is both funny and suspenseful , with a good deal of its plot made up of the kind of material reserved for a sociologist who is writing a treatise on why certain types of people must be outlaws ; the director's aim was to make a take-off on the treasure of the sierra madre theme , but this time with a stoned-out foursome lured by the possibility of making 3 million dollars through growing and dealing marijuana . a lot of the big-name stars in the film must have seen the merits of this enterprise , because their cameo appearances and the small amount of money they received for being in the film indicates that this was strictly a labor of love for them . it therefore left a very cloudy message about what is a serious matter concerning the whole drug culture . it was a much clearer film to evaluate , if viewed as an enjoyable dark comedy . but don't be mislead by what i just said . this is a well-written and acted and directed film , that is often disarmingly brilliant , getting right in the face of an outlaw lifestyle that is both dangerous and beautiful . it does this better than any other film i have seen in recent times that attempted to tackle this sort of material . the implied message is : the government's drug policy is just not working . 
what is going on inside her , is seen through the marvelously constructed dream sequences of her in africa- as a griot , an african musical storyteller , chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs- that are very emotionally received by her . this is the kind of filmmaking bertolucci does best . there is an element of vague beauty and mystery in these sequences that evoke a sense of wonder . strangely enough , their past seems to be becoming more and more inconsequential . the imponderable emotions of love are caught in the music , the stunning visual spectacle of the film , and in the quietude of their personalities . how this works out , is how hard to say . it wasn't easy for me to be sure if love meant the same thing for both of them . the glib ending didn't help me understand them any better , as it felt like something was missing from their relationship , something that either i didn't catch or something that was just left out of their relationship that shouldn't have been . their acting was first-rate and very unnerving , we could see their thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen ; it is ultimately what makes this film somewhat special . the up and down career of bertolucci , is up again after this less than epic film ( actually made for an hour tv program , but lengthened for the sake of a feature movie ) . it is the kind of small art story that bertolucci seems to excel in more than with some of his more recent commercial ventures ( little buddha , the last emperor ) . that even though this story was an obvious and abbreviated one , it was still a joy to see . what the story means , is not tied in with some of the director's political or psychological ideas of the past . this is more or less a film that lives through its style and grace of letting the two of them tell their story without much help from the script . and it worked out better than these kind of films usually do , mainly because there is a power in bertolucci's direction that maybe someday he can put it all together and live up to the potential that was once expected of him . all his films are worth looking at , and this one more so than what i have seen in a long time from him . it sort of grows on you , and seems more emotionally satisfying the more you think about it . 
it is an elegantly sentimental work touching on the rituals observed on an army post . those were indeed more simplistic times , but not totally out of the realm of how some modern day soldiers may feel . the twists in the story line come from the quirks the characters display not from the story itself , which is rather ordinary : the comraderie between the captain and the very irish top sergeant ( mclaglen ) , who likes a bit of whiskey and adds comic relief to the stodginess of the army routine , fits in with the buddy theme of many ford films . a virtue that is considered essential for any character in a ford movie , that he really cares about . it adds to the feeling that the past cannot be ignored . winton hoch , the cinematographer , won an oscar for the visually memorable mesas and haunting loneliness of the monument valley landscape , which was used as the film's location sites . it provides the film with an epic scale of the country , as there is a melancholy intermingled in those vistas with a sense of reverie for the men who are so far away from civilization , surrounded by the red sand and barren mountain peaks , yet are greater practitioners of civilized etiquettes than even the citizens back east , through their daily obediance to rank and order and their need to socialize by formal dance and their chilvary toward women , which might seem old-fashioned but is pleasantly accomplished here . what pulls the film together and gives it a raw power , is something that can only be ascertained by accepting ford's premise that it is absolutely necessary what the men do and that they are in the right . to scrutinize this film in any other way , is to lose track of what direction the film meant to be going . to add color and more sentimentality to the story , there is the theme song of the yellow ribbon , played countless times , either to the immense pleasure of most viewers or to some , to grate on their nerves . the calvary should follow them to their reservations , but stay out of sight so the indians wouldn't be humiliated by the men watching them . this is ford's look at the west and the cavalry men he adores so much . perhaps the scene that summarizes the film's intentions best , is when wayne is given a solid silver watch by the men for his retirement , and the presenting of the gift and the accepting of it , are met with a few well-chosen words , each weighed heavily with an aura of mutual respect , almost bringing tears to wayne's and the audience's eyes , as he reads the inscription that you know means so much to him . if you can see that as a glorious and magnificent scene , you will have , most likely , fallen in love with this grand and lyrical film . but if you don't , you can still be swept away by the eloquence of the film and its call for some kind of majesty of action one should have , in this beautiful , god created country , that ford believes has room in it for everyone who acts civilly . 
there is something about this chic look at modern english society- one that is filled with wanton sex , drugs , and violence- that is more frightening than all the mayhem , perversities , muggings , and rapes it shows on screen . i think that something has to do with the fear we have of trusting the young people depicted in the film with the future of the country . the film is shot in such pleasingly stylish colors , especially the orange background , whereby the film gets its title from . it is so visually splendid a film , that it is shameful that we are confronted with so much violence , as it seems that even the violence as presented and choreographed is all too entertaining for the grim message it is trying to deliver . one might be beguiled into expecting a musical film to be taking place , if one were not aware that kubrick was the director . sex is the old in-and-out thing ; if they want an auto they just steal it , and for someone they don't like , they just pummel them . there is a strong enough reaction to these things to induce a nausea in him . kubrick's look at society is an unduly pessimistic one . there is something evil in society , but what to do about it , that is the question that remains . at least , for kubrick , we better think about what we are doing to ourselves , before it is too late . the most frightening part of the film , was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement , are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are . i was left feeling unsure of how to take the film's message . was there a moral ambiguity exhibited toward the violence ? there just doesn't seem to be much to think about as alternatives to the way the problem youth was handled . the film adaption from anthony burgess' satiric novel , results in a pure kubrick over-indulgent , brilliantly visual and graphic film . the jargonistic language used ( called nadsat- an onomatopoetic combination of english , russian , and slang ) made for a most arresting film , one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems . but i just don't think we come away knowing anything more about what to do about these problems than before seeing the film . nevertheless , i did find it to be a visual joyride , something that is terrifyingly pertinent in an eerie sort of way ; a memorable film , one that has become ingrained in our culture and must be looked upon as one of those 'important' films that one should see . i just didn't think it reached the level of some of his other masterpieces ( 2001 , paths of glory , the killing , eyes wide shut , and dr . strangelove ) , that , for me , were on more solid intellectual footing . 
fast-paced action and witty one-liners , allow this hitchcock-like story to be both amusing and thrilling . and the surprise ending is a beaut , which should catch you off-guard , as you will most likely be misled and unable to guess who the murderer is . jolly good fun . a real delightful and snappy film , featuring mystery , humor , snappy dialogue , and a great surprise ending . 
jimi hendrix was too stoned to adequately perform " foxy lady . " the obnoxious announcer , rikki farr , goes so far as calling the crowd " pigs , " wavering back and forth between conjoling and chiding them , with neither strategy doing anything but creating more bad feelings . the crowd shots showed rampant hashish smoke and psychedelic drugs being ingested , nudity , the potential for a riot , and talk among the concert goers that this was a just a " money " thing , as the feelings of idealism or another woodstock , which was only one year earlier , seemed like ancient history . the director of this film had to wait 25 years after the concert to release the movie , as the promoters went belly-up over the concert . what is suprisingly good is the sound of the film and the high quality of the music . this film was no woodstock , but it had a charm of its own , and is certainly worth seeing not only for the music but for the history of the period . the moody blues sang a great rendition of " white satin . " 
the noir look of the film is enhanced by it being shot at the actual location of the incident . this taut , well-told story , is suspenseful in the noir tradition of showing dark shadows and setting a dark mood . the acting is superb , screenwriter richard murphy received an academy award nomination , and elia kazan , in his afterthought comments about the film , mentioned that he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail . 
i felt like i was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant oscar wilde comedy/drama costume play turned movie , and i must confess , i enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of it , as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley of epigrams . it is a modern play , even though it is one that was written in the last century for an audience that was more or less reflective of the characters portrayed on stage . for the elite audience that attended the play , oscar wilde , after mocking the english nobility would , at least , leave them with a thinly disguised compliment , by telling them no one can be ideal . the film was put to screen by the manipulative wizardry of miramax ( shakespeare in love , the wings of the dove ) , who know from the success of some of their recent films quite well how to popularize an already popular literary work by broadening its emotional appeal . they gave the audiences what they wanted , a film that has a romantic heart in it and is not just hilariously flippant , and they should be commended for improving an imperfect but successful play . it rarely happens when a commercial venture turns out to critically improve a work of so called " art , " so when it does happen , it should be shouted from the highest mountain peaks . everything is thoroughly enjoyable and agreeable about this wonderfully delightful work of subtle wit and brilliant dialogue . rupert everett stands out as a sheer delight in a cast that is almost perfect ( julianne moore could have been a tad more sinister ) . everett's role is one that he relishes in , as he says of himself , " i love talking about nothing , it's the only thing i know anything about . " minnie driver is simply bubbling over with charm and wit to match his . their flirtations are one of dueling wits , with amusing lunges and enough double-entendres to get through any intellectual armor worn . there are so many witty phrases to revel in , but my favorite one is when lord goring says , " morality is only for those you don't like . " writer/director oliver parker ( othello ) has created a lighthearted film for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating . 
windhorse takes us right into modern tibet and tells how the tibetans survive in a country that is not really theirs anymore . it is a well-done and necessary propaganda film ( though even its propaganda is nuanced and made lyrical to a large extent ) . somehow or other the world has to receive the message from the tibetans , who are undergoing at the hands of their suppressors , the chinese communists , a policy of genocide that will probably continue unchecked unless something is done to stop it . this film is one of the ways of getting out this message . this fictionalized drama has to be told and this serious film ( probably preaching to the choir ) cannot be judged as other films are for its entertainment value . if you are seeing this film to be entertained , you are in the wrong movie house , though the exquisite natural beauty of the country and the entrancing holy city of lhasa- and its potala ( the largest buddhist structure in the world ) - offer quite a lot of sights to behold . the brutality the tibetans are under is clearly shown , as the film will tell its story as humanly as it can , through the eyes of one family , and it will show their hardships and disruptions to be symbolic for the sufferings of all tibetans . he steals the picture with this gut-wrenching performance . this travesty really hits home and shames them into actively supporting the non-violent tibetan cause for freedom . what is simply amazing throughout the story is the gentleness of the tibetans , who exhibit no violent tendencies despite all these incidents , and when you compare them with the barbarian behavior of their chinese rulers , you can easily see that this is a story of good vs . evil . it is easy to see why china doesn't want the truth about its human rights violations known , or about the murders it commits and acts of brutality , and its spy system and systematic control over its subjects , or how it refuses to allow the people to even have pictures of the dalai lama in their homes , arresting those that do . the film opens and ends on a powerful spiritual note , as you would expect from a people who value so highly their traditional knowledge of buddhism . thereby , the film will rest its case that the spirit world will always be there for them . director wagner and screenwriter tsering have pulled off a major accomplishment . that makes this a very special film for me , but it will probably be too one-dimensional a story for those who feel it lacks the impact of dramatics and cannot forgive the film for urgently wishing to send out its message at the expense of being more " artistic . " but i left the theater with the impression that i was watching a brave people clinging to the belief that they could find in their hearts all the goodness they need to get over this dark spot in their history . i thought it was a well-meaning film that had its exceptional moments , like fully realizing the relationship of dadon and duan-ping as symbolic of the possible reconciliation of the two countrys . but does the film reach an audience that doesn't know thetibetan situation ? i hope it does reach a wider american audience than what i think it will , because i believe that the cause here is just , the acting is first-class , the film is beautifully crafted , and that all people of good faith must stand together and give hope to each other , in any small or large way that they can . if this fictionalized film wasn't about the real life situation in tibet and had the same mundane story , i could see it being criticized for being melodramatic . but since the politics of the times indicate that this film does make a difference , so much so that the chinese government is doing everything in its power to ban it , i therefore think that speaks volumes for how effective this film is as a political vehicle and how its cinematic importance is enhanced by the unflinching bravery of the tibetan actors and their families still living in tibet , still the subject of untold horrors . 
what works very well for coppola , is the over-all mood he captures of how the inner city kids react to their identity crises . we see how they are turned off by school and how they don't have proper parental guidance ; it is also pointed out that if these kids had the proper role models things might be a lot different for them . " the motorcycle kid " is an existential hero , saying very little ; but if you get into his rap , he is more likely to be a hero found in a camus story than in a teen film . that makes his characterization seem controversial and arbitrary here . he has a swagger to him and a way about him that makes him larger than life , even mythic . everything he does ends in violence or in an incomprehensible situation . there was not really anything new revealed about this sort of character that hasn't been seen in other teen films ; but , the film does have the gritty feel of reality to it and intelligence in how the story was presented . i'm on the side of those who liked this emotionally wrought , stylized film , adapted from a novel by s . e . hinton , warts and all . it brought a higher quality to this teen genre film than usually seen in such films , even if , i doubt if it would reach the troubled kids the film was about , who in all probability , would not choose to see such an arresting film . to the film's credit , it was not a glossy look at the kids : it had the good sense to stay true to its theme without just blaming society for the problems presented . 
the concept of illumination , whence the title of the film comes from , refers to st . augustine's theory of enlightenment . it is what fills the mind with light ; it is a spiritual happening that is the most powerful thing in the world . the hero is likable , somewhat courageous and scholarly , a person of integrity and loyalty , and is the only hope for poland's future . this is a glum film , but intellectually sound , offering many pleasurable introspective moments , but lacking in real illumination , which prevents it from being a great film . that is certainly an arguable statement , as even the protagonist in the story eventually realizes not everything can be settled by rational arguments . 
the persian gulf war of 1991 is put to celluloid and made into this action-packed adventure story and intelligent political satire of the once seemingly popular war , that would supposedly regain the american sense of " feeling good " about itself that needed resurrection after the vietnam debacle . this was a war that made americans proud of the technology developed such as , smart bombs , and of how casualty free and quickly the war was won , as it was watched on tv . he has made an unconventional but traditional anti-war hollywood movie , in the likes of films such as , catch-22 and m * a * s * h . this one has a potent bite to it , just like the others , but maybe because it is filmed so soon after the bubble for american success has busted , that it seems to have such a deliciously absurd bite to it . it makes one wonder who the americans really have helped with this war aside from some rich kuwaitis . what the film clearly shows , is that the bulk of the iraqi people , not the inner circle of the dictator , seem to be bearing the brunt of the war's dire consequences . the premise of the film is excellent ; the story succeeds as both an entertaining action film and as a searingly funny black comedy , it is even effective as a valuable history lesson . the actors are brilliantly cast and make up for the lack of depth of their characters by giving engaging performances : george clooney is both heroic and devilish , presenting a commanding stature for his authoritative role . jonze is a real hoot and comes across as the kind of dim soldier whom it is easy to feel sorry for and not get too upset with him over his obvious mental defects . ice cube is solid . what results is a brave film , one that has a surreal and trippy feel to it , with some mortifying comedy dished out and some serious questions being raised about a war that can't come to a proper conclusion anytime too soon , as russell explores a recent part of american history that surprisingly hasn't been touched upon by other films , as of yet . the war is covered with more personal detail than i got from watching it on cnn . i feel that the filmmaker has caught the mood of most of the soldiers , who don't understand the politics of the war and just want to go home in one piece , of the career brass who are in it for promotions , the media reporters who want to not only get the story but be the first one to get it , and the politicians who can find a rational for whatever they do . the film ultimately shows that anything is possible in the amoral climate of a dictatorship and a consumer country out to protect its own interest . the reward for the audience , is seeing an exciting film , with beautiful cinematography , in addition to seeing a film that has a grave purpose to it and is funny in a serious way . 
this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film . her unattentive folks don't even realize what is eating at her , that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement , and that she lacks self-esteem , thinking of herself as being unattractive . ricky and lester will share this same vision of life , as this becomes the film's mantra , reinforced several times throughout the film : that redemption can be gotten through love . this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film , before the credits are shown . the viewer is told by lester , from the other world : that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters , someday you will . the lesson to be learnt is , that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken away from people ; it remains behind everything that is . this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters . if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for , even if that is quickly seen as a sham , then what the director brilliantly does , is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal , even those who might think that they are normal . so what are they striving for , if not normalcy ? what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed . it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity , and that its barbs about suburbia are on target . but the film succeeds , and in some regards is brilliant , not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform , but because the acting was grand by everyone , and spacey was more than grand , his was a tour-de-force performance . he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish . he's that good of an actor to carry this film , even as he is supported by a terrific cast , he still stands out as the star . bening is his perfect foil , with a special flare for comedy , but still , through no fault of hers , is a cardboard villain , with no room to grow . mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end . thora , a 17-year-old veteran actress , even at that tender age , played a twisted and sullen figure , but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure , giving a soulful performance , in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play , but not necessarily play better . cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual , but his role as a villain was also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it , even if his performance was first-class . so why did i just like the film very much but not love it ? i think it is because , as entertaining as this film was , something just didn't smell right about these roses ; everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface ; there was no real revolution of character going on . i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester , ricky , and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for , even if , the film implies that is just what they did do . the satire also became mean-spirited , at this point , as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes , as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs , by implying those jobs are just for losers . his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away . when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the 70-ish-year-old master of his craft , conrad l . hall , gave us , who is an expert on lighting techniques , and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering about , is how shallow it all is , in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface . in the end , this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is , should be dismissed as nothing but hype . yet it is a captivating film , one that had its moments of grandeur , and all-in-all , i really was absorbed in it , and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have . 
the tune emanating from the piano is a passionate one , coming forth on a desolate new zealand coastline , far removed from european culture , where a piano is seen as something peculiar to possess in such a backward area of the world . it is used symbolically to represent the works of civilization that can soothe the savage beast , if the beast is lonely and willing to listen to something he usually doesn't listen to . the underlying premise of the film is one of communication or lack of it in a world that can be cold , and of how easy it is to never find love in such a world . her voiceover says , " this is not the sound of my voice you are hearing ; it is the sound of my mind . " she these scenes are very powerful and surprisingly enough come across as being sensual , even if , the proposal as put-forth , at first , seemed to be an obvious power-play against a hapless victim . but campion knows how to draw out the passions from these scenes and make this unlikely romance between these opposites bloom . all that he knows , is that he just wants her physically , that he feels her inside his gut ; and , that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought possible , is precisely what gives impetus to this gothic romance . michael nyman's astonishing score , performed by holly hunter herself , expresses the explosive mood of this extraordinary visionary film . a film whose silence and music speaks for itself as an apt way of communicating . harvey keitel , masking a nyc accent by talking in some kind of maori pigeon tongue , is ably cast as the brooding lover who turns out to have a gentle soul , something this loner must have felt in his heart for a long time but now emerges inside him and gives the film a certain kind of raw power to it . anna paquin , in my opinion , is the best surprise in the film , the one with the most difficult role , and the one with the biggest part in the film . what makes it all the more amazing is that she is a mere child , asked to play a part on equal footing with all the accomplished actors she is surrounded by . her performance is the key one ; it is the one that propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love . she is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found in this backward place and the passion she feels from baines , as it seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her . the film is brought slowly together by jane campion's masterful direction , whose understanding of the erotic desires of the characters is right on the mark , with the result being an original and haunting film , a story that grew more intensively disturbing for me the longer i thought about it . stuart dryburgh's camera captures the internal mood of the characters , as well as the monotonous beauty and the oppressive reality of the countryside . but the film misses the mark , at times , as the two main characters , stewart and baines , despite their fine performances , are nevertheless too one-dimensional to give the film more of an impact . it seems as if this is ada's story to tell and no one else's . this is a film , nevertheless , that will justifiably garner great interest because of her very trying performance . 
lynn hershman leeson is the director/writer of an intriguing cyber-fantasy film . it is a film that is strong on ideas about artificial life , memory , and immortality ; and , in the innovative technology it uses to convey its virtual reality story by using the latest in cutting edge technology , such as digital software photoshop programs . the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors' placement and camera movement . the actors appeared before nothing but a bluescreen and were photographed with a digital betacam and this was then transferred to computer images depicting the same victorian bed-and-breakfast rooms where ada byron king actually resided , the actors and the authentic rooms were then seen together in the live video . the film is much weaker on its drama than on its technology , as its characters seem to pale a bit besides the computerized images of artificial life that it created . nevertheless , for computer geeks , this is a definite must see ; for others , it should be of considerable interest to the more intellectual-minded who like to see something different for a change in a film , in a film that also has the ability to challenge the usual concepts of what reality is thought to be . as envisioned by ada , this information can lead to composing music and creating a poetic language . one of his pearls of wisdom goes something like this , " information is like a mist that you have to breathe in . " the concept offered in this film , of the possibility to retreat to the past for communication with historical figures and to gather information from stored memory , is an alluring idea and is certainly one that gives this intelligently made film a highbrow premise worth savoring . what weakness' there are to the story , come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place-- but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow . as a result , that very riveting performance of a first-class actress , one of the very best , the illuminated tilda swinton ( orlando ) , is overshadowed by the film's inability to be more energetically engaging , though some effort was made to bring more life and passion into the story by showing both emmy's and ada's sexual passions unfold . but the story couldn't completely connect with all the characters involved and bring out their side of the story . if the film remained more focused on ada's story and we understood her work a little bit more , and if we saw why babbage got credit for the invention not her , it would have been in all probability an even better film . swinton is that good of a performer to have carried this film further if given more camera time . the film's ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus , not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring . yet for those on the lookout for a brainy non-hollywood film , one that has an original flare to it , this one should prove to be more than satisfactory . 
" sleepy hollow " is like many other tim burton and danny elfman collaborations : a visual treat and a stylistic thriller . it may not contain tremendous substance but it is sure a pleasure to look at . i took a brief look at an e-text of the original " the legend of sleepy hollow " by washington irving ( as any remaining memory i had of the legend itself came from the disney movie and only featured the headless horseman riding about ) , and i must say i liked what the writers were able to sculpt out of the original story . they had to , because the original might have been a fun read but was no movie material . instead , it is to their credit that we get interesting and * convincing * characters from colonial times who seem to have leapt right out of the real story from irving , when in fact most of them were newly created . now i am not so worried for those who might have their plot spoiled for them because they have read the book . much better than that " psycho " remake fiasco , eh ? the town of sleepy hollow is but one out of many of the film's visual triumphs . perpetually shrouded in fog and gloom , the town seems steeped in misery even in daytime . even the haystacks look morose . the film begins with awkward shots and a slackening pace but eventually picks up its rythmn . this gets repetitive and pretty much every time the sun sets we know what is going to happen . we also saw too many heads actually getting chopped off . if we hadn't gotten used it so quickly , perhaps it would have a greater effect on us . that , however , doesn't distract from the horror when it * does * happen . the film is a triumph of black and white and shades of grey ( only to be disrupted by the end by that horrible sunlight ) and mesmerizing visual images and effects . particularly enchanting are ichabod's memory scenes which are beautiful yet horrifying to look at . johnny depp plays a wonderfully amusing ichabod crane ; and while christina ricci was decent in her role , i still maintain that she was miscast because she looks too much like a child . the rest of the characters were just as superbly cast . not only was the film a wonderfully macabre piece , it was a glimpse into states of affairs when an earlier turn of century was about to arrive . it was a treat surveying the costumes , the settings , their " autopsy bay " and ichabod's peculiar tools . things that most of us in modern america have forgotten ever existed before . picture an edward gorey cartoon . ever seen one of those ? there's no story to it . it's just death , and even though it is a simple cartoon , it conjures up a sense of dread in you . that is comparable to watching " sleepy hollow . " it's a gorgeously illustrated children's book that creeps the heck out of childrens and adults alike . * was that martin landau prancing through cornfields in the beginning of the movie ? kind of reminded me of that other movie he was in last summer , where two main characters also ran through cornfields . * and here we have christopher walken with his 15th reprisal of the role of the freaky villain . * there is a nice variation on an oft-seen movie cliche . tired of seeing action movies where hero and villain are at each other's throats on top of a moving bus/car/train/sailbot/spaceship ? * the beckoning hand was a nice touch . 
this dream-like fantasy film , probably a fairytale story gone amok , filmed in the style of german expressionism ala " the cabinet of dr . caligari , " and most reflective of a kafkaesque type of story depicting a man trapped by absurd circumstances and his mistrust of society , as the film sets a nightmarish tone . there are deer antlers that hang on the walls and pine cones and needles on the floors of the classroom . the use of deer must hold some symbolic meaning to the story , but i would only be guessing as to exactly what . the lessons take place in a dilapidated building , with a creepy looking and uninviting interior , setting the claustrophobic atmosphere the film thrives on . he will remain here until the school crumbles , as it seems to be coming to a slow but sure end , as the director announces no more students will be taken in after jakob . what is the reality of life if everything can be turned upside down and what does reality mean , might be some of the things the film is questioning , that is , if one were looking for a theme to this intriguing tale , filmed in a grainy black-and-white monochrome , which added to the film's evocative mood . jakob asks , " is there anything jesus could do for us in this world ? " the film succeeds in being a hypnotic work of much visual merit , that is different in scope and in intention than other films , probably defying classification into a type of genre it belongs to . there is hardly any dialogue , and the sparse dialogue that is there , does not seem to be that pertinent to the story , as the actors recite their lines as if they were puppets on a string being manipulated by the quays . but it is the aesthetics that seem to count for what are the dramatics of the film . its story of the high and the low in status , each accepting unconditionally their place in society are examined in a most bizarre fashion in the student's and his master's mannerisms , as all the repressed students who willingly serve at their master's discretion go through their eerie robotic movements , and the story has the look of a spellbinding fairytale . the film runs its course with alternating moods of exhileration and tedium , but proves itself to be visually stimulating overall , with every scene showing the contrasts between the light and dark of life . there was also the memorable weird scene in the beginning of the film , where a face appears distorted through a goldfish bowl . but , this unsettling film is , nevertheless , diverting in a positive intellectual way , even as it is subject to much speculative interpretation . you can look at it as a visionary poem or as an allegory on life , either way , the film is original and stimulating , if one can take the very slow pace of its camera work and its tenor of dull melancholy and its inconclusiveness into proper consideration . the film was stylishly scored by polish composer lech jankowski . 
how can a bad film be good ? well , in the hands of edgar g . ulmer , it is possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it , on the edgy words of the protagonist , who wonders to himself how , " fate could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all , " and not be laughed at as pretentious dialogue . instead , this work becomes a memorable cult film that can so easily in lesser hands than the skilled ulmer , have fallen into the realm of inanity , but here becomes a strong film about the meaning of fate . what is most amazing , though , is that this film was shot in six days in a poverty row studio on an extremely low budget , without an attempt to get any location shots for a story that centers around a cross-country hitchhiking trip , and yet it remains gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors . it remains fully a part of the rich history of b&w noir films . it is also an example of what the big studios can't seem to do well , how in their attempt to make a film that is pleasing to a large market share of the audience , they too often lose track of how interesting a story can be without the usual formula applied to it or the need for making it glitzy , and they fail to get into the soul of their stars , where they should have been going in the first place . which might explain how this poorly acted , weakly-crafted story , was so much applauded by film buffs that it has reached classical cult status in film lore and is even revered by certain noted directors such as martin scorsese , and was held-up by the french movie critics as a work of true art when they discovered the neglected film in 1950 . in a voiceover , he asks , " did you ever want to forget anything and can't because there is always something that comes up to remind you of what you were trying to forget ? " the most memorable part of the film , the part that seemed the eeriest and most convincing comes next , as al starts to panic and can't think clearly . he goes over in his mind the choices he has , as he keeps saying to himself who would believe me if i told them what happened : 1 ) my first instinct tells me to run . 2 ) the next possibility is to sit tight and wait for the cops . his weak character and not his criminal act of stealing haskell's identity are the cause of his downfall . ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study , that plays like a mesmerizing confession , as the hero has the intangible quality of innocence going for him , which adds a seductive quality to his character for those in the audience , such as me , who can appreciate his natural inclination not to trust the authorities , even when that seems to be the most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in . to understand that , is to begin to understand the power of a noir film , probably the most original cinematic work the american film industry has produced . the noir hero is just not like the other hollywood heroes ; he does not see the world in technicolor . 
alvin's eyesight is so poor , that he doesn't have a driver's license , he walks with a cane , has a bad hip , has emphysema , and is as stubborn as a mule ; therefore , even though , it doesn't make too much sense to travel the way he does , no one can talk him out of it . the film reeks of midwestern wholesomeness , folksiness , and homespun philosophies . that it works so well , is a testament to richard farnsworth's compelling characterization and the flavor the film captures of the genuine straight people playing straight man to alvin straight on the two-lane highway he takes across the mississippi river to wisconsin . it features a road show of ordinary folks , consisting of those who can be kind to a stranger who is doing something he probably ought not be doing . their ordinary lives are put under the microscope in a slow-moving tale that is not in a hurry to get to the end of its journey , as the strangers talk to each other , seriously listen to each other , and we as an audience get to know all of them reasonably well . as a change of pace , american viewers might welcome a pause from all the action films and whacky stories they are inundated with , and take a reality check to see if they are interested in seeing a film that most of them could have been in . times . " the film plays as if it was a foreign film , since it is rare for an american film to be so self-conscious of itself , so interested in just looking at the open blue sky , the blowing wheatfields , the bare streets of a sleepy town , and having its star find peace with himself without any reason or big event in the film . it is also a film that knows how to keep proper time with its slow-moving story and the slow-moving transport of its hero . by doing this , it suggests that his life can be carefully digested without everything being brought to a conclusion before it needs to be . some of the vignettes worked better than others , but what was always convincing was how the unsophisticated but straight-forward manner of farnsworth , came across in such an appealing way , a way many americans would like to think of themselves as actually being . yet , lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she was becoming less confused about what to do , and by having her symbolically show that she understood what alvin told her to do . fortunately , nothing much is made of this event , except alvin has the common sense to have some deer meat for his nightly camp fire . the film moves into territory where people of good nature really communicate with each other and offer whatever support they can to each other , and it is the right support because they have tapped into the source that gives them such character , which is what the kindly relationship that developed between danny and alvin offered . this film was just right for what it wanted to do ; it felt good seeing alvin's journey find closure . the sentimentality of the film was kept to the minimum and lynch did not try to make this small story grander than what it was , and that's a good thing , because the smallness of the story is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem epic . but , in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about small-town america and its elderly , it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldn't delve deeper and get more out of the story , as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such small-town conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelled-up , the people seem so unintellectual , and the places visited so dull , notwithstanding , how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency . after initially being very pleased with the film , i got to wondering what i learned about alvin straight that i didn't know when the film began ; and , though i thought that alvin's reflections about his life were genuine , i still didn't really know what he is all about by the film's end , even if i now knew his darkest secret , and that is what troubles me most about this film . there is something about his life that makes me think of alvin as not only a likable character , which is what i found him to be , but someone who is so set-in-his-ways that he cannot evolve further , and he is someone who is so accepting of the " american way of life , " that it seems a shame that he can't find anything to say that questions the america and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during ww11 . he would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the religious right . there seems to be no rebel in alvin , as lynch seems to accept his status quo without any hesitation . alvin , for all his appeal , just seems to be another blind follower of the so-called american value system . it was difficult for me to see lynch's motivations for making this simple story without offering any ruffles in the feathers of the american eagle . though , he certainly has a right to see things the way he does ; it , nevertheless , is disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional american values without even questioning them . but if this is just a mild tale about an old-timer , doing something a little ornery , then it works and is pleasant to look at , just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on main street with some real people . it makes you feel good , but is that challenging enough ? i still don't know what lynch's motivation is for making this walt disney family value production film , except it seems to be an ode to traditional values , which seems odd coming from him , especially since he is known , rightly or wrongly , for making films that are supposed to be on-the-cutting-edge . there was nothing daring about this film , as its appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of richard farnsworth , who is a movic relic , chiseled in dignity with his weather-beaten face and his geezer-like sensibilities shining through . he is someone beyond acting criticism , and whatever failings or misplaced points there are to his story , the film is still a relatively interesting work , retaining something about the american mythos that is worth investigating further ; this is a film that is well-crafted and well-worth seeing , and this is so because lynch knows how to film a story in a thoroughly professional manner . as for lynch personally , i don't have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his changing career moves might mean , but as far as this film goes , he seems to be very accepting of the status quo . 
i only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it plays much like many a classical western , but is shot in the '60s style of " point blank , " and is scripted by lem dobbs , most probably , for the entertainment value it provides . i also know that a limey is a slang term for a brit and that he is played with a bravura performance by terence stamp . the story frequently goes from what he is thinking to some flashback to some future thing he wants to do , therefore the time sequence is often confusing . if there is supposed to be a deeper meaning than revenge in this very titillating feature , it is hard to say what that deeper meaning is , unless from all the garbled cockney sayings by wilson , this is a film about what the meaning of one's life is , as a senior citizen who had plenty of time by himself to give the question adequate thought , as we see that he from time-to-time reflects on that subject . in any case , this film seems to be all style and that style is wonderful to behold . it is also a film about nostalgia , as it brings back haunting memories of a time that was intermixed with hope and confusion . the '60s are dismissed here , as only being what happened in 1966- and early '67 , and that golden " hippie " age is further reduced to a few golden moments of feeling free through the promising new music arriving on the scene . steven sodergergh ( sex , lies , and videotape/kafka/schizopolis/out of sight ) has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but offer promises of much more . the director makes frequent flashback cuts to the stamp of younger film days , using the 1967 film he was in , as it becomes more and more evident that this film has many purposes to it , not excluding the former real-life film roles of its present iconic stars and how they are now portrayed onscreen . perhaps , the '60s itself was mostly an innocent call for a better world that was manipulated by those who knew better , like the terry valentine's of the world . therefore style over substance isn't all that bad a message for this intensely shot nouveau-noir work , that seemed to be saying something like that or maybe it's just that the king's english , even when spoken by a common criminal in a rich cockney accent , sounds so worthwhile , that i have been so duly conditioned to believe that about the english language , that i would listen keenly to anyone who spoke like that and believe i was listening to something philosophical . 
he seems to be interested in just surviving , there is no political savvy about him , as he seems unconcerned about the reasons for the korean war and what it means . the picture is graphic and direct . it could be read as an allegory about the war , except fuller keeps it to be a no-nonsense telling of the war , one where man is on his own to make of it whatever he wants , not relying on compassion or sentimentality to survive but his own instincts . the most important thing is to come out of it alive . what they are observing is quite different from what buddha meant by observation . this low-budget film from lippert studios is probably the best film they ever made . this is a beautifully done b&w action film , one of the most powerful war stories ever made . gene evans , in his debut movie role , is nothing short of sensational . the film is taut and grim , and is excellently paced , holding one's interest throughout . 
david lynch's nightmare debut film is shot in wonderful b&w ( in the expressionist mode of a german horror film ) . it features a unique soundtrack that is mostly made up of constant shrill sounds that might destroy your inner peace ( clangs , hissings , whistles , street noise , etc . ) , but it also has a lovely little song tract , sung by the deformed lady in the radiator ( laurel near ) , with the catchy lyric , " everything is fine in heaven , " as it is meant to offer hope to the despondent hero of this dream , who is probably thinking about suicide as an answer to his problems . the film is a long dream-sequence about an awful urban smoke-infested industrial city and other terrible things . this weird tale is an original , personal , and provoking work , capturing the darker side of modern urban life for the have-nots and the dark side of the dreamworld for the dreamer . the story makes little sense in the real world of things , but has its own logic within the contexts of the film . at least , certain experiences drawn from its little episodes can be related to one's own experiences , as it makes a striking impact on one's fragile modern psyche . this is what a cult film is supposed to be like , and in that sense , there is a certain ready-made audience for this film , who should be accepting of it even if they don't know what the film means in total . and , that's not so bad a thing in the case of this movie . those who like their films with a solid narrative , will not find what they are looking for here . he has a distinct nerdlike look , featuring a bride of frankenstein hairstyle and in his lapel there is a plastic-holder for his pencils and pens . the conversation is so slow in coming forth , that it is painful to listen to . inward tension , results in a dream within a dream , which shows henry's head being lopped off and made into a pencil-eraser , whereby the film gets its title from . he is seen appearing in a rock , slightly above henry's facial features . this is a film not made for strictly entertainment value , and to get the viewer involved in thinking about what all these symbols mean , requires some imagination on their part to interpret the dream . i would hazard a guess and say that the worm has something to do with the deformed baby and the concept of original sin . what it all means , is probably anyone's guess . but it is visual and shocking to the intellect . it is one of the more imaginative efforts put forth in an american film , reminding me most of a bunuel film . that as illogical , tedious , and repulsive as it may be , there is still something there that grabs our attention before we can turn away from it . somehow i get the feeling there are lots of people who can identify with henry , even if they will not admit to being nerds . i just loved the idea of the film , admittedly more than i loved watching the film ( i saw it on video , where the images were sometimes too dark ) . yet i found this imaginative work to be one of the more interesting films to come out of the '70s . 
tod browning's ( dracula/the unholy three ) outstanding film addresses the point about watching a film such as this one , with a long-winded rejoinder ( this " crawl " was added to the film after its original release by the producer who bought the film from mgm , dwain esper ) . it is basically an apology to his audience for the freaks used in the film , taking note of the usual revulsion most people have when they view the abnormal , as he points out that the majority of freaks , themselves , are endowed with normal thoughts . looking at those who are pinheads , limbless , dwarves , a bearded lady and her baby bearded girl , twins physically attached to each other by the hip , and the assorted other real freaks used in this film , has its initial shock to those not used to seeing the abnormal , but that should soon wear off and what remains is how sympathetic the audience becomes to the freaks , who are part of a travelling circus sideshow . this apology was not needed . mgm has foolishly edited out 30-minutes of the film , thus reducing this b&w horror film to around 63-minutes . the price paid , is that character development for some of the subplots fails to materialize with any conviction felt . which is a revolting statement about where that country's sense of freedom of speech is at , more than it was a reflection of how gross the picture was . the wedding celebration turns into a macabre scene , that is both vexing and titillating to a certain degree . she is last heard clucking like a chicken . the final scene , which has the look of being tacked on , was indeed tacked on , as the studio insisted on a happy ending . i would have to think because of the way the film was cut , the characters of phroso and his lady friend venus , were never developed and remain dry portrayals . their roles were just not that interesting . that is how the film opened and closed . the obvious themes of the film are that there is strength in numbers , that the beauty of an individual should be judged by their inner character and not by their outward appearance , that we are all human beings and that to mock someone else is like mocking ourselves , and that one shouldn't prejudge individuals in a biased way . if those aims are controversial , then it is no wonder there is still so much irrational hatred in the world . and by the way , browning did not exploit the freaks , as the critics in the 1930s said , he made the normal people who were intolerant to be the grotesque ones . 
possibly the best british noir film ever made , a film adapted from the graham greene novel . the tourist bureau was so afraid that this gloomy look at brighton would scare off tourists , that the film opens with a " crawl " telling what a safe and jolly playground community brighton now is . in fact , he is more sympathetic to the killer in the film , no matter that he is a certifiable maniac . while he is too far gone , to do anything about what is right or wrong in the world . ida shoots back that people never change- " i haven't . " the last scene in the film is one of those memorable ones that just can't be easily forgotten . it has a raw power in it that a noir film commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly onscreen , even if the scene was changed from the one in greene's novel . further saying , " i got his voice-i got proof of his love . " we have to hope and pray . when rose puts the record on , we have already heard what pinkie said and wait to see her reaction , but when she plays the record : " what you want me to say is i love you , " the record gets stuck and plays that over and over , until the final shot of the film is of the crucifix on the wall , with rose , seemingly , elated to have her love reaffirmed by such a positive proof . this cynical ending is perfect . the filmmakers thought it could be construed as possibly a happy ending for the filmgoers who thrive on a happy ending overcoming the general despair of the film . but the film was a failure at the box office . the only weakness in the film was the awkward pacing of the story and the over inflated role of hermione baddeley . it was a brassy portrayal that detracted from the noir mood of the film . richard attenborough's manic performace as a psychopathic , androgynous character , who had violent mood swings , was pulsatingly brilliant . his sadomasochistic relationship with the naive rose , coupled with dark shots of the seamy side of brighton , plus the expressionistic studio shots , gave the film a raw energy that makes it more powerful than the usual gangster film . if you have any kind of feel for noir films , this one is in the don't miss category . 
this is a wonderfully chaotic work , meriting high praise for what it tried to do and not condemnation for what it failed to do . there's such a thing as something being spoiled because it has too many good things going for it . that is the case with this ensemble dramatic piece , whose most telling fault is that it eventually resembles an overblown soap opera , going on for far too long . its three hours length and many subplots will attest to that , even though it is artfully woven together , but could in all honesty , have enough material for five other movies within it . therefore it is not surprising that the ingenuously talented director , the 29-year-old paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights/hard eight ) , had to finally tie-up all the loose ends of the story into a nice knot , which resulted in an ending that won't please too many because it might seem absurd . but i found myself accepting of its biblical ending and was impressed by the overall stupendous effort of this exuberant film , that is pumped with self-confidence and a virtuoso style . a work that mirrors greatness even if it doesn't quite keep that greatness in proper focus . the film does go on for too long , with the only thing that could save it from never ending is a biblical miracle , but it settles instead for a plague right out of exodus in the bible to make its farewell . that improbable ending was set up and apologized for in its prologue by the offscreen narrator , who explained three different bizarre chance happenings as unlikely but possible , giving cause for the improbable ending the film comes up with , and after all , how absurd could that ending be , if the bible used the same material ! the reward the viewer gets for sitting through the long and highly structured but at times confusing film , that tries to picture life as being a matter of coincidences , is how brilliant the individual skits were and how fine the acting was . even tom cruise , as his estranged son , playing an obnoxious hustling infomercials maker for the product he is selling to men , so that they can conquer women , was done with a blend of humor and pathos , making his role less obnoxious than it could have been . in a role that reminded me , of jean-pierre leaud' outlandish performance in " irma vep . " here , cruise goes for the jugular , as a boorish male predator , someone who is just plain unlikable and prone to going off on rants . cruise is becoming a noticeably more polished actor ever since his kubrick stint in " eyes wide shut , " and deserves much praise for this role . they are all-tied together too neatly and the outcome of their sufferings is too predictable for my taste . but that can't begin to explain how penetrating a human drama this is and how acutely aware the young director is of the people's misery and heartaches he highlights . he is mostly guilty of being excessive , wanting to put too much of a good thing on the plate , in this robert altman's short cuts-nashville like production . but anderson offers more meat in his character's parts than did altman and more finesse in telling his story , allowing his actors to expand their roles more . the performances by all were superb , but reilly's and hoffman's were better than superb , in a film that didn't have a featured player , but allowed each performer to take his or her time telling their story , as anderson was able to create a somewhat seamless work out of this separate skits , making use of different camera angles , using tv intercutting methods , fast-cut editing , and utilizing a provocative visual style . he also made the story seem fresh and moving in many different directions to catch all the personalities involved in the story . he also made use of a song , through the performance of aimee mann , who somewhere more than half-way through the film , sings the theme song of the film , and it is heard first by one character , then another , until all the film's troubled souls are brought together by a single refrain . " it's not . . . whatever fault one might find with the film , that fault is countered by how interesting and refreshing the film felt , and with the director's flair for taking risks . the unbelievable tale puts one into the mood of the magic happening onscreen , and the magic was not necessarily in what was extraordinary and not in the cleverly plotted coincidences , but in the telling tragedies of the lost souls and their injured psyches , casualities that are inevitable in america's modern world of consumerism . 
john alton is an excellent cinematographer , with noir films being his specialty , as his camera knows how to capture that shadowy world of half-lit images and dark background scenery . his camera work adds the extra-element of suspense and by using many different and odd camera angles he makes things seem unbalanced , something that works rather well for this nightmarish tale . in this film , the director and the cinematographer are fortunate to have a tight , tough , no-nonsense script to work with and they make the best of it , touching a raw nerve or two , as the film is fast-paced and packed with scenes that are shockingly brutal . this film is one of the best kept noir secrets , as it is not mentioned enough when powerful noir films are discussed by aficionados of the genre . this is usually the man's role in such films . we have witnessed a special poetic moment in noir film , a shot that has since become a classic , telling more in its noir imagery than words could ever express . this was the weakest scene in the movie . it seemed too contrived , as the killer's wild comment to them was , " i killed her but i don't know why ; i deserve to die . " but it , somehow , sounds to her , that he is saying it to ann not her . the photography is electric , consisting of low angle shots and reflections of light coming in from the open window , giving the scene a naturally eerie look and a depth perception creating the illusion of how far apart the men have now become in their lives , as the light from the candelabra highlights the shadows in the room . this fatalistic drama ends in total violence , with no winners . it's a sad reminder of burning desires and romantic dreams going up in flames . claire's voiceover narration gives the film some added chills , and the three main characters become studies in emotional deprivation , giving the film an added depth in its character study . the acting was first-rate . the look of the film was beyond reasonable expectations of how good a noir film should look . the sexual tension was penetrating . this was , to say the very least , an interesting work . 
an old-fashioned coming-of-age story with a big heart ; " the cider house rules " is a slow-moving tale that builds on its characterizations and never waivers in the warmness of its story , no matter , even if somehow events turn sour . it is the kind of humanistic story hollywood can do very well , when it puts its mind to it , and in this production has done itself proud , making it the kind of film oscar is partial to . the one fly in the ointment , is its pro-choice emphasis , probably too controversial for hollywood to want to deal with , even if the director has gone out of his way to be evenhanded in presenting both sides of the issue in the film and so far no outcries from church groups against the film have materialized . the film took him 13 years in trying to get the project off the ground ; the result is a pleasingly sensitive narrative , avoiding anything too sugary . the only thing homer won't do , is abortions . the main theme of the film is that in your life it's most important " to be of use . " the rules that make the most sense , are the one's that are made by the party concerned , not by some outsider . the good doctor would be happy delivering babies and not doing abortions , if he thought that all the babies he delivered would be adopted . the only question he couldn't answer , probably because it is a question that can't be answered , is when homer says , " what if i were aborted ? that would mean i wouldn't have had a chance to live . " it reminded me of going to an animal shelter to adopt a dog and watching how they also make friendly gestures at their prospective owners . the point made , is that the children still want to go home to a family , despite this orphanage being such a kindly run place . the second part of the film involves the good-hearted , quiet and sincere homer , seeing life from a point of view away from the orphanage . swedish director lasse hallstr ? m ( my life as a dog/what's eating gilbert grape ? ) has made an articulate film , one that goes over territory such as abortion , incest , murder , and forging records , and asks the viewer to use their intelligence in seeing what is right or wrong . it is , at all times , a visually beautiful film . the children are heart-stoppers , and caine is simply brilliant in drawing them out . there is not one flawed scene in the story , in a story that has a few subplots that run parallel to its main motif . homer's insightful look at the world , is also the viewer's way of seeing things the way a child would , who hungers so much for honest affection and is striving to find his place in the world . the filmmaker has told a positive story , in a straight narrative style . the only failing in the film is that , maybe , the director walked too fine a line in regards to the subplot in the film , about the abortion issue , not making his motives absolutely clear , when it seems obvious where the film's heart lies , anyway . but , maybe the filmmaker wasn't clear enough in where the film's leanings were and answered it like a liberal republican engaged in a presidential primary might be forced to answer the question , in order not to scare the right- wing away from him . as for me , this is a beautiful and delicate film , that all but spells out its leanings for pro-choice being a practical answer to the controversial problem . yet some movie reviewers , including the esteemed roger ebert , the most widely read critic in america , find that the theme of the film is muddled . ebert is not sure what the point of the story is about , as it seems to arrive at no clear point of view , for his tastes . a response like that surprises me , because it is one thing to not like the film , but i can't see not liking it for that reason , since i found the direction the film was heading down to be very clear and i had no trouble with its showing how terrifying an ordeal an abortion could be , as it also showed how necessary it was not to leave an abortion in the the hands of someone with a coat-hanger , that it was a medical problem as much as it was an ethical problem and a decision that only the one with the pregnancy problem could decide whether it was the right or wrong thing to do . i couldn't see how the filmmaker could be clearer about what side of the fence the film was on . the story had a natural rhythm to it , and the relationship between caine and maguire wasn't contrived , but seemed to generate its own energy ; it seemed genuinely affecting . i felt very touched by the film and its ability to tell such a heartbreaking story in such a sensitive and intelligent manner , without it being an art house film . 
the iverson ranch at chatsworth , a movie site rented out to all studios , was dressed up and used for the technicolor production of rko's rancho notorious , giving the film its artificial look . nevertheless , lang's western overcame that obstacle and today is considered as one of the strongest and the most unusual westerns of its kind , a film that could not be dragged down by the bickering between lang and dietrich during the filming , or by the low budget ordered by howard hughes which kept most of the work in the studio , or by hughes' taking lloyd gough's name off the credits because he failed to testify in the huac's hollywood witchhunt . it was the first westerns to make use of a folk ballad , which was played at various times during the film , called chuck-a-luck , to bolster its theme of " hate , murder , and revenge . " this was a ludicrous concept to believe , as if one expected the bandits to be honest with her and give her the exact amount to stay , but it is fair to say , that reality was not one of the film's strong points . it's lang's best and last western , one that covers again the themes he successfully used in his noir films , and one that makes good use of his expressionistic style of filmmaking . but aside from looking old , marlene proved she was up to the part acting-wise , giving a mannered and brilliant performance , making this western a legendary one . it has a certain electricity about it that makes it special , even if does seem a bit corny at times . 
max oph ? ls ( caught/lola montes/the earrings of madame de . . . ) is a director not usually associated with noir film , in fact his films tend to be the antithesis of such films . but , nonetheless , he has come-up with a first-class melodramatic thriller , very much in the noir spirit , by complementing guffey's photographs of shadowy figures and a dark city scene , with long craning shots , quick-darting movements of the heroine's nervous actions , and a style of camerawork that is not necessarily suited for a noir film , using an encircling camera , giving the scene an airy feel of possible freedom . bennett and mason give sterling performances , pulling out all the nuances of their roles . the film is taut and tense , elegantly directed by oph ? ls in a simple but powerful way . a very engaging thriller , every bit as good as the more respectable films the classy director has made . 
a neat noir thriller that has a slight variation on the " double indemnity " theme , this time it is the guy who is the seducer . dalton trumbo , the blacklisted writer , is the uncredited cowriter of the script . his trademark signal at the end of his show is , " i'll be seeing you susan . " this is particularly annoying for webb , as he calls his voice oily . as for the contemptuous van heflin , who really has a disregard for others , his love for keyes was real but not enough for him , he had to also have the superficial material things of life to satisfy his weak ego . these two stars gave superb performances in this arresting thriller that is scripted with a social conscience and a taut sense of reality . 
cecilia roth , the wonderful argentinian-born actress , is the focal point of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of motherhood . in this film there is little difference between what is real and what is fake . this is the 13th pedro almod ? var film i have seen , one that many critics say shows the aging , enfant terrible director maturing , becoming kinder and gentler , showing a capacity for making a film with more of a conventional plot and being less interested in shocking his audience as he once loved to do . but the shock is still there , enough of it to keep it from becoming a mainstream film . to visually show her path back and forth from barcelona to madrid , there is a stunningly photographed tunnel looking very much like a womb , with a train racing through it . though the film has a pungency to it , there are just too many scenes where the wit seems forced and doesn't flow in the natural rhythm of the story . the film is filled with many references and homages to other hollywood films and to writers , something that is both good and bad . it is good because too many films are devoid of any intellectual influences . bad because the references are overused here , making the director's gushy homages too syrupy for my taste buds . but he doesn't know that . this is a story about many different things : its subplots could take you into areas such as organ donors , aids , coincidences , family relationships , family values , and the affects of pop culture on the public ( take note of that hilarious diaper commercial , an actual one shown on spanish tv ) ; but , the film's main premises were about : praising actresses , praising motherhood , praising sexual ambiguity , and praising the kindness from strangers ( tolerance of all people seems to be the strongest message emanating from the film ) . the mixed feelings i got about the film come from my not being sure if this film is meant to be taken as a parody or a tragic soap opera . there were times i didn't know whether i was supposed to laugh at all this or cry . this film is melodramatic in the tradition of the douglas sirk nuclear family romantic rock hudson and dorothy malone ones of the 1950s , but with almod ? var , it becomes even a weepier one , one that is mostly outrageous , one whose family nature is more ambiguous and certainly not nuclear . it is a film that is paradoxical : men can be actresses also . the deftness of the cinematography and the array of colors displayed are simply dazzling . this film could be enjoyed solely for its bright orange , red and yellow patterns , giving the eye a startling light show to feast on , as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty to another . it is worth noting , that there is no criticism by the director for any of his characters , no matter how they screw things up . the problem with all this adulation is that all the flattery has a hollow ring to it , it is just too good to be true , and his characters are not completely believable because of this . the film's strength lies in the emotions of the characters ; their close-ups revealing an inner strength in them , that no matter what they've been through , they will stick together and not succumb to their overwhelming problems . a pregnant nun in an almod ? var film shouldn't be that surprising to his fans , in fact what else should they expect ! this is another of the director's themes , of how the ones who are supposed to be normal and try so hard to convey that impression , are really fakes , while the ones who are considered to be oddballs in society , could be the normal ones , who are at least living out their fantasies . the hurt look on rosa's face after her father leaves , gives us a picture of her thought process that is better than dialogue , it is one that is worth savoring . there is one scene when agrado announces that the performance of " streetcar . . . " of course , this clears most of the audience out , with those few remaining being mostly the young and more daring ones , the same audience that has sustained the director over the years . she proceeds to tell how he got put together into a she and how much each part cost , in a comic bit that seemed , at least it did to me , that the director was trying to please his audience too much . trying the actors were all splendid . i was particularly impressed by marisa paredes' subtle but invigorating performance . the aging actress had a certain air about her that invigorated every scene she was in , showing how vulnerable and engaging an actress she is . but when the spotlight was on marisa , what the director was trying to say about actresses' had a clarity about it that didn't seem forced . but still , what makes an almod ? var film special , is his eye for visual effects . i haven't seen a more stunning visual film all year ( it is comparable to kubrick's " eyes wide shut " ) . i was so dazzled by the visuals , that the film's metaphors , bizarre tale , and great actors , seem to take second place to the visual splendor of the film . as good as this film is , one of the problems almod ? var still has , is that he can't make his outrageous characters distinguishable from caricatures . this cloy act of his does not make agrado any more compelling . one must give almod ? var credit for getting his voice heard in the mainstream while keeping his artististic integrity intact . that is not an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary references to it , despite the differences i have with his approach to the characters and their development . the film's story line is ludicrous but the hurt the characters receive as perceived by them is real . almod ? var retains in this work an intriguing call for the bizarre , that keeps the film from descending toward being a hollywood one . but it also never reaches great artistic heights . there are no breakthroughs in character study . this is basically still a message film . a most amusing and diverting portrayal of the sexually ambiguous , but not a great film . the critical success of this film makes for strange bedfellows , when the 'chic' cannes crowd hooted in disappointment that the film wasn't chosen as the best one in the festival , but cheered when almod ? var won for best director , they now might be considered as part of the usual almod ? var fan base of weirdoes and independent-minded movie goers , a fan base that seems to be growing to accomodate a different type of enthusiast , one that is more establishment orientated . 
this is one of the top fight films ever made , along with raging bull and body and soul . it is reportedly the role robert ryan , the college boxing whiz liked the best , and the one he probably gave his best performance in . it is the only boxing film developed from a poem . it was fleshed out into a screenplay by boxing aficionado art cohn . wise captured the mood of the smoked-filled arena , the fans' reactions , and the dirtiness of the boxing world . the film looks as if it is being shot in real time , as stoker awaits in the dressing room , exchanging good-natured barbs with the other boxers present and listening to their nervous chatter . the boxing scenes looked real . the crowd was made up of an assortment of fans , some there to wager , others to eat and enjoy themselves , some getting a kick out of the mayhem seen , and a blind man- having his pal give him a detailed description of the fight- just loving the violence . at this point , tiny tells his fighter the fix is in . ryan's performance gives this film the human drama the other great boxing movies just couldn't deliver . his drive to win despite knowing what that victory will ultimately mean and the noble way he handles himself , provides this film with an insiders look into the boxer's virile nature and the foolish pride he has in winning . the set-up was one of the few films ever made in which narrative time and screen time are the same-72 minutes . wise brought in former boxing professional john indrisano to make sure the choreographed fight scenes were realistic . wise , striving for realism above all , visited the boxing places around the long beach area , basing the boxing fans chosen for the film on the same type of people he saw while attending those matches . 
leos carax's inspiration for this film was jean vigo's masterpiece " l'atalante " ( 1934 ) . there is nothing pretty about these characters or endearing about the situation they are in , and it has a frighteningly real look to it . this high-budget fantasy film is directed by leos carax ( boy meets girl/bad blood ) ; it is one of the most costly french films ever made . the story is a quiet one , an imitation of the life and sounds of all the things happening in their surroundings . it is not a story where we are going to find out much about these three , just enough so that we have a little feel of how they came to be there . what this reckless film is about ( it is reckless because it is not about logical people ) , is something that can't easily be explained because it is a poetical vision about those who have gone over the line of sanity . this film is visual cinema , dialogue is not that relevant . we observe the madness of their lives and how love is so difficult to comprehend but is the only thing that is out there that can't be taken away from them , that it becomes the rationale of the film . this could have been made as a silent film , it could be viewed like murnau's " sunrise , " as the disenfranchised view the bright lights of a modern urban city for how it might corrupt those who live there . in the meantime , while the film stopped shooting , she had a few breakthrough roles and could have gone to make more glamorous films at higher pay , but she felt committed to this project and did finish the film . commercially the film bombed , but critically it received many great reviews . there were also quite a few negative ones , and the one from vincent canby in the n . y . times really hurt . it delayed the release date in america . the ones who hated this film , seemed to really hate it . i appreciated the film , finding it to be slow-moving but a startling and compelling film , that had a unique way of influencing my sensibilities through its images . not quite a masterpiece , but a film that made my heart go out to its lovers . 
katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . 
there is also a dark side to life that david lynch ( eraserhead/the elephant man/dune ) wants to show you in the underbelly of normalcy and that's what gets explored in this fantastic , original american film of his . jeffrey has entered into a dark world of madness , a world that most of the people of lumberton could never imagine exists in their community . hopper is madly funny and menacing in one of his all-time best over-the-edge roles . he is the energy of the film . he has lines like " let me f * ck everything that movies ! " . maclachlan : " heineken " hopper : " f * ck that shit , pabst blue ribbon ! " there were many quirky moments in a film that was as straight as a curve ball . one conversation between dern and kyle goes like this : laura : " i don't know if you are a detective or a pervert ! " jeff : " that's for me to know and you to find out . " this is a highly personal film . for those looking to criticize it these might be some reasons to do so : it relies on shock to tell its forgettable story , it fails to develop character emphasizing style instead , and the acting seems more staged than spontaneous . it was shocking to see , but i didn't feel that lynch glossed over this scene lightly . i think it set a mood for how painful and humiliating life is , and these incidences do happen more regularly in contemporary america than some would care to admit . all these possible flaws in the film , still do not detract from how visually powerful the story was and how it had such a unique feel to it , as if it were capturing something about the american heartland that hasn't been told in this way before . i loved the film for its intransigencies . what it has going for it in large measures is a sense of freshness , imagination , and an almost seamless melding of beauty and violence . this non-commercial film should satisfy lynch's fans and those looking for a film that doesn't pull its punches . others might dislike it for being so plainly weird and shock-orientated , admiring it only for its craftsmanship . i think they will have sold this film short ; after all , strange stuff happens all the time , and the most interesting people are the so called " normal " ones . i believe that is what happened in this film , and though its motivations are ambiguous , it does hit some kind of sore spot for respectable society to consider , without turning up its nose at all the revolting things this story brought to the surface . 
it is a film that should satisfy the protesters of the war for its depiction of it as being without merit , but it also should satisfy those who are entertained by the blood and gore action scenes . it portends to be a film about the real war in vietnam and not someone's metaphor for the war . it is 1967 . on patrol , the stillness of this alien place is disturbing even if it is visually beautiful . no one cares if the new men live or die . if they survive , it will be mostly because of luck . sgt . sgt . these scenes are masterfully done by stone , as it is a reminder of my lai , although it doesn't turn into such a disastrous outcome . it is shown from the soldier's perspective , how war dehumanizes one and survival becomes a basic instinct . some act brutally . some do what is ethical . some just want to make sure they don't overlook the danger they are in and act cautiously . but since the men are in a dangerous situation , it is hard to determine what is really the correct thing to do , except there is no excuse for the excessive cruelty shown by some of the men . this is a visceral film , even if the enemy is not distinguishable in battle and appear like shadowy figures . for some of the others , they will do anything they can to make it out of here . . . even smoke weed until everything seems unreal . platoon is a moving film about the horrors of war . it is a visual film that explores the reality of the actual war , told from the soldier's point of view . it is one of the better war films made because it seems real . the director's one fault , was that he couldn't resist feeding the audience with his opinion , not able to rely completely on the visual impact of his story to do the job . 
the film is grandiose and colorfully shot , seeming much like a travelog . the original film had a more ironical and less standard ending than this version . but this is a highly appetizing film and a more attractive one to view . granger gives a commanding macho performance and the vistas are delightfully magnicent , which should be enough of a reason for seeing this version , also . 
an mgm dazzler , a striking musical , satirizing the staging of a broadway play . it is a technically superior work , making up for a thin plot with plenty of lively musical scores and dance numbers , and a constant barrage of witty dialogue . many critics consider this one to be the best musical of all time . the musical becomes the stage for the battle between pop culture versus high art , with the film favoring the low brow art form . clifton webb was first-choice for the buchanan part , but he turned it down because it wasn't a starring role . however , he did recommend buchanan to the studio for the part , and the studio was rewarded in its choice by getting an outstanding performance from him . this is a film dominated by its magnificent musical numbers scored by howard dietz and arthur schwartz . the songs include the following : 'a shine on your shoes , ' 'dancing in the dark , ' 'that's entertainment , ' 'by myself , ' my favorite number about triplets who do not like each other- 'triplets , ' 'new sun in the sky , ' 'i guess i'll have to change my plans- the highlight of this number is a soft-shoe by astaire and buchanan , ' 'louisiana hayride , ' 'i love louisa , ' and an eight-minute dream number that is the climax of the film-- a jazz-dance spoof on mickey spillane's 'girl hunt , ' with cyd showing off her long dancing legs as a femme fatale in a smoky barroom and delivering a very sexy routine in a sequined red dress and black mesh tights . this technicolor dance routine didn't seem to fit into the rest of the film , except it seemed to point out what the film was trying to say about mixing together both art forms , as the dance was both derived from the lexicon of pop culture and from the high arts . the marton scenarists write a broadway show for tony hunter and get the pretentious jeffrey cordova to direct it . they both feel inferior when not doing the role they feel comfortable in and try to see if they can work out a satisfactory way in which to be dance partners . the martons are disappointed that the director has ignored their script . he converts the play back to the marton's fluffy original script . it all ends on a happily banal note , as they sing 'that's entertainment , ' signifying that whether it's a play by shakespeare or bojangles dancing , you still have to entertain an audience . the arthur freed production team , true to the film's theme , have created a most entertaining film . vincent minnelli's direction was accomplished with much style and panache . if you like an old-fashioned broadway musical , you can't go wrong with this one . 
the naive ? ngela wonders , at first , could a film such as this cause a heart attack for the viewer . chema recognizes that it is a digital camera xt-500 used , by noting the grainy quality of the film . he also chides ? ngela for being so aloof , for not learning much in film school and for not being able to observe the minute details in filmmaking . he feels rejected by her lack of attention to him , and even asks her why don't you like me , i have money , too ! he proclaims that film directors have to make violent films to please the public , and that they have every right to . what the 22-year-old director , amen ? bar , is trying to do , is show that the public is hypocritical in its condemnation of porn/gore films , because these films wouldn't be made if there wasn't such a tremendous market for them . chema says that the police don't like him and that there is no proof . her lone investigation was too much to believe , that for someone as smart as she is , to make herself so vulnerable didn't seem likely . this slick suspense story works very well on capturing her fear and following the trail to the killer , but fails to be convincing in showing how the public's prurient interest in violent smut is the reason filmmaker's make such degrading films . the young director has an exciting way of filming and keeping one engrossed in the story , thereby achieving a very curious fantasy film , one that is filled with many psychological overtones , but it is derivative film and can't lay claim for being original . 
this odets' work was originally performed as a neo-realist broadway play in 1941 , with tallulah bankhead in the stanwyck role . she can't resist anymore and tries to make a relationship with earl work , fed-up that jerry is so dull . the performances are stagy but filled with fiery emotion . everything about these characters and their alienation seemed natural , something that was grounded by lang's showing them at work , never cutting them off from all the travails they were going through just to exist . it's a film that reminded me of how easy it is , not to see the faults in yourself as easy as it is too see it in someone else . 
everyone knows how bad it is to be called a chicken--it could mess up one's self-image worst than the wind can mess up a ducktail haircut for a teenager in the 1950s--as this liberal-inspired social commentary film plunges right into that 1950s eisenhower era mind-set , without trepidation . it's a film that sympathetically sides with the rebellious youths and their befuddled parents , and it doesn't even demonize the police . it airs out the prevalent problems of the mid-'50s for these youngsters ; such as , loneliness , alienation , lack of love , fitting in with their peers , their identity crises , and the lack of communication with their folks . all these well-off kids ride to school together in this open car , acting loud and stupid , proud to be dumb americans . for all its aging and the changing mores of the times and the ever-increasing complexities of modern youth , this creaky film still has a rawness about it , something that is intangible , that gets into your spine and brings out a chill or two , that tells you this dramatization was real . 
stage fright is a hardly frightening but , nonetheless , laudable movie , that features hitchcock's droll humor and his perfection in regards to set arrangements . this is a mystery tale that is not too difficult to figure out who the guilty party is , but the fun comes in playing along with the man on the run theme and to follow along with his love stricken wannabe actress maiden heroine and her eccentric family , and take-in the mae west-like performance from the incomparable marlene dietrich , as charlotte inwood , a stage actress/chanteuse with a rather vulgar personality and an odd sense of humor , who rules the london stage world as if she were a pampered peacock with fangs . this film is more of a romantic comedy than a suspense film , though there is an element of grave danger that comes about in the final scene for the heroine . she is acceptable in this damsel-in-distress role , but doesn't really sparkle in the role and make you feel for her , perhaps , like a grace kelly would have . this film , the second one hitchcock has done in england since his return there from america , is one of the master's most subtle and sharpest comic efforts . stage fright is sandwiched in between hitcock's " under capricorn " and " strangers on a train " , and is equal to if not better than both . this is certainly not hitchcock's best work , it is not suspenseful enough for that , after all , the master of suspense should live up to his reputation . but , the film is very diverting and artfully done , and dietrich was never better . watching her performance alone , was enough for me to love this hitchcock work , even though it is merely a minor one in his opus . 
poetry is the vehicle of choice for how the story is best transcribed onscreen , since dialogue is almost non-existent . it is told as if time doesn't exist , one event runs into another and everything seems jumbled . images of water and fire are used throughout the film for purposes of symbolically cleansing the soul and destroying the impurities in it . paint is used as a contrast to blood . in a film loaded with contrasts , the huge gap between most of the population which is poor , is harshly contrasted with those who have money to burn . innocence is being corrupted by the experienced , proving that nothing remains pure in this city that steals one's life , one's poetry , and one's spirit . which signifies that there is something despairing about the foreign influence in vietnam , but what that despair exactly means , is never clearly stated in the context of the story . he somehow keeps her a virgin by having her do all the kinky sex tricks that do not involve touching , like peeing for a customer . this film is a visual masterpiece , capturing the frenetic pace of life in the city and the faces of sorrow on the poor ; it paints an unsentimental picture of a place that is a living hell . but it is not a masterpiece storywise , as its storyline was rambling , laying no specific blame for what is happening on the local government or for that matter , on anyone , only implying how rotten the western influence is . also , it seemed to me , there were too many violent scenes , as the filmmaker seems to revel in them without expounding on them . this powerful film offers westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a third world country , a country most americans only envision in a depersonalized way , but the film still had too many gaps in its storytelling and too many loose ends it left not fully developed . cyclo , as a person , should have been more flesh-and-blood like , rather than used as merely a morbid symbolic example of the loss of innocence . there was something there that just seemed to be elusive about the film , the director just wouldn't let the viewer get into without imposing his own personal barriers ; he doesn't even want to give us their real names , as if he thought , we would sully their hardships even more than it already is . he mainly wants to shock our sensibilities , to have us look plaintively at his native country like he does , even if he too is only a tourist . there is nothing wrong with that in itself , but his social designs could have been painted with clearer brush strokes . the contrast between those who are gentle and those who are brutal , and those who are dreamers and those who can't dream anymore , could have been better utilized than to point out the obvious , of how wretched a place this is and of how the gentle ( innocent ) have little chance of succeeding . still , this is one powerful film , filled with relentless and disturbing visualizations , whose poetic voice comes from the inside of the director and is strong and boiling over with metaphorical emotion . cyclo was a deserved winner of a golden lion award for best film at the venice film festival . 
a thoroughly enjoyable film about a pitiless serial killer of middle-aged women , that is played for laughs at the expense of the women victims . it is a black comedy , acclaimed for its stellar performances , especially by rod steiger as christopher gill , the psychologically warped killer , with a severe mother fixation , who uses a number of disguises to commit the murders and performs the murders as if he was on-stage , being only natural , considering that he is an accomplished broadway actor and well-known theater owner , and the son of a great actress . this presents an interesting contrast with the way the killer handles his neuroses . his performance is endearing and heckart's is amusingly right on target . she is delightfully refreshing , offering her beauty , sensitivity , and comedy in a splendid performance . this is an actor's film and they all make the most of it . steiger calls him the next day and offers to become segal's telephone confidant , but tells him , " remember , i am smarter than you are . " it was difficult not to find this witty film funny and its romantic subplot equally charming . 
taxman is a wonderfully played cynical , offbeat , low-key thriller with comic undertones , also exhibiting plenty of local atmosphere and human intensity . the israeli-born avi nesher co-wrote the screenplay with roger berger , who did the real-live tax investigation of this actual case . nesher directed the film with a flare for making a caper film come to life . unfortunately , no one else cares . they both can't help it , they have personalities that rub people the wrong way , even if they don't mean to be annoying and are supposedly intelligent , they are still kept at the bottom-level of their jobs . the film had many different mood swings -- ranging from the joyous russian wedding reception for nadia the two sleuths attended , their frustrating conversations about the ups-and-downs of the case , and the action-packed mob hit by the two suicidal chechnyan hit men of the likable gas station owner , and the chase of one of the hit men through the off-season beachfront property of coney island . in the end , these two did all they could to get justice , and the results were mixed , but better than what could be expected . the film had many endearing qualities : the cast was magnificent ; the novice cop was an unforgettable character ; the taxman was even more unforgettable ; elizabeth berkley is a beautiful sight for sore eyes and her russian accent was as good as pate from zabars ; and , the story , though thoroughly routine , was presented with a certain grittiness that elevated it to the level of those el trains running above the brighton beach russian community . 
the vanishing is a challenging psychological thriller about a nightmare that comes true and an obsession that leads to bizarre results . it makes the most of its tale by its vivid dream sequences and the masterly holding off of its inevitable findings until its conclusion , as it relies on the viewer becoming overwhelmed with curiosity to hang on until the end . it is a superbly done suspense yarn relating to what lengths someone will go to find out something that he feels he must know about himself , as this tale is told without the usual horror film special effects . it consists of the real everydayness situations , which makes the mystery seem even scarier . the theme of disappearance has been attempted by many great directors , such as hitchcock , in his the lady vanishes , but it has never been done as spookily as it is here and from such a simple storyline . each time he goes to the designated spot of the meeting there is no one there , but he feels the presence of that person . the performances are particularly good , with gene bervoets being made into a victim , becoming a kafkaesque figure , trapped in a world that is not of his making . while johanna ter steege gives the film an inner light that captures the prevailing mood of the mystery . she is so sweet , honest , and endearing , that the continuing curiosity gene shows for what happened to her is very understandable . and , bernard-pierre donnadieu is perfectly credible as a self-absorbed psycho , someone who is devoid of passion , as his crime is not sexually motivated even if he seems to only target pretty woman ( he says that he does so because they don't expect to be victims ) . this film is so well-crafted , that it is easy to get carried away and think that more is being said here than what has transpired . but in the simplicity of its story , it becomes easy to identify with the amsterdam couple and feel caught up in their dreamworld which intermingles with their real-life . a film that is very much in the hitchcock suspense mode , as a real-chiller . 
a thoroughly enjoyable claude chabrol detective story , covering ground the director is very familiar with from his previous successes with this kind of a mystery story . the director is in a playful mood and builds a crime scene around kinky characters , hypocrites , lowlifes , and druggies , as he parodies bourgeois life . the film starts with a surprise and ends with a debatable moral ending to the murder case , which is geared to be pleasing to the audience's sense of what is right rather than one that follows the law or the integrity of the inspector's profession . the inspector is the focal point of the film and the way he operates is a rough imitation of sherlock holmes . his reactions to what occurs is how we are led to believe we should see the film . poiret is superb , his dry wit and the persistent way he carries out the investigation , sets the film's laconic tone , setting up the bizarre turn of events in a magnificently comic fashion . this is a purely entertaining film , with no great insights into life to be discovered but , with some great looks at how absurd life really is . the joy in the film is expressed best through the following actors : the dreamy and soft performance of lafont , the spry and eccentric performance from brialy , who was in a chabrol film some thirty years ago , and from poiret's strongly understated performance , holding back his feelings by letting his action do the talking . this is chabrol at his most playful , which offers some surprises , shocks , and amusement .

this lyrical film shared with " taste of cherry " the palme d'or for 1997 . it's a virtuous film that after its violent beginning settles down and becomes an amusing and insightful study about a man trying to find himself after spending the last eight years in prison . it is interesting to note how this couple take this murderer into their home , something that would not likely happen in america . though imamura paints yamashita's character as being serious and withdrawn , there are comical interludes which make him seem plain daffy . he explains , that he talks to the eel because he listens to what i say . an interesting film , that works most effectively as an introspective study of how to deal with one's anger and love . 
he speaks in a hesitatingly slow , thick southern drawl , and is a very modest , inward man . his life is a difficult one , where his level of discomfort is beyond reasonable expectations . but he is not dull . all the film's energy goes into ian holm's stellar performance . this is a wonderful screen adaption , as scripted by howard a . rodman , who caught the nostalgic and generous mood of greenwich village of the 1940s . ian holm's performance is brilliant and sparkling , one of his best in his long and distinguished career . this cautionary story pictures a city that has changed so much from joe gould's time , that a talented eccentric nowadays should expect to receive no help from a city that is becoming less interested in helping its weirdo artists or its mentally ill , instead turning its attention to more mundane concerns . 
this is an overlooked noir thriller--shamefully it couldn't get a british film distributor to give it a wide release when it opened . jack wants to do things in a honest way to win , whether as a writer or as a croupier , who makes it a point of telling us how much he hates cheats , yet by a twist of fate , part of the forced psychodynamics of the story , jack ends up like all the other cheats , choosing to be dishonest . the cynical message inferred , is that one can't change human nature , that sooner or later one will have to make a choice and bend the rules to accomodate who one is . in a plot that can be faulted only for its contrived surprise ending and a death of one of the main players near the end , that adds absolutely nothing to the story , what remains striking , is the passion the croupier has for casino life and how it relates to his passion for writing . but , as with the many other subplots , its theme is never fully realized . when compared to three recent films about gambling , " casino , " " the rounders " and " reindeer games , " there is no comparison , this one was the more real and pertinent one . it is only too bad that " croupier " couldn't feel more committed to the power of the lyrical voice-over and less to the canned responses of all the odd twists it had to throw into the story , that diminished the bleak truth it was harping at -- of how life itself is a game of chance and the casino is only a cheap imitation of life . in the end , the film's stylish depiction of the casino milieu , its thrilling noir ambiance , and the character study of the croupier , override the film's failure to end the film convincingly with the kind of payoff that this thriller warranted . it turns out , that this compelling story is just as much about being a writer as it is about being a croupier . but the ace it has up its sleeve , is the distinguished performance by clive owen . 
this is a well crafted sci-fi film from the 1950s , that became a cult favorite and helped generate interest in the sci-fi film as a popular genre . it had a well-intentioned liberal message in the face of the time's mccarthy witch hunts , it only lacked an edge to its straightforward rational call for world peace and an end to the nuclear arms race . this intelligent and humanitarian film plays like a christian allegory . klaatu even uses the alias mr . carpenter , an obvious reference to christ . lock martin played gort . bernard herrmann's brilliantly haunting musical score aided in capturing the alien atmosphere of the story . it's hard to argue with the rational message delivered , i just wished the film took on the politics of the scientists sleeping in the same bed with the government , who are just as much a detriment to world peace as the xenophobic media and the cowardly bunch of world leaders . 
it sets a high standard for submarine films , as a well-crafted , serious work , that created a lot of nail-biting tension and evoked a suspenseful atmosphere , and might very well be the best submarine film ever made . wolfgang petersen was nominated but did not win an oscar for his directing . it also gave the director a chance to come to hollywood to show off his ability to shoot action films , where he made " in the line of fire " / " air force one " / " perfect storm . " das boot was one of the most popular foreign films in america at the time , and is still doing very well in its video rentals . the ships were escorted by destroyers and were sometimes protected by airplanes . that was an amazing scene . i couldn't imagine a hollywood film showing americans not rescuing drowning seamen , even if their submarine had no room for the prisoners . what this excellently told story fails to do , is come to terms with the political situation or the moral implications of the war . it is seen best as a film that is technically superb , drawing out the reality of what it is like to be on the submarine and showing how terrible it is to go to war . the boat constructed by rolf zehetbauer and g ? tz weidner , which duplicates the cramped boat down to its grimy details , and provides the film with the proper setting for its intense realism . the superb use of sound , helped elevate this film above all other submarine films , as every sound in the quiet of the submarine is heard : the splashing against a destroyer's propellers , the eerie ping sounds , the bellowing roar of a depth charge , and the creaks of a hull . jurgen prochnow's sterling performance gave the film the quiet hero it needed to anchor its story , as his will to fight , his intelligent leadership , and his quiet determinism to fight a glorious war , were nobly shown , as the men under him completely respected him . the crew was made up of sympathetic figures and not cardboard nazis most ww11 films seen from an american perspective portray onscreen for the germans . what the film seemed to be aiming at , was not a big statement against war , but how the captain was a professional and treated his men accordingly , expecting them to do their best no matter what . the film succeeds in humanizing the men in this mostly true story , as it highlights the crew when it is singing their favorite song , " it's a long way to tipperary , " and that's the most vocal this very quiet , very emotionally gripping , and very entertaining film will get about anything . 
kadosh means sacred in hebrew . this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . meir is a talmudic scholar . meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . 
this might be the best junkie film ever made . the new zealander , alison maclean ( crush ) , directed denis johnson's book of short dramatic stories with a sharp eye for comedy , where the addiction story plays second fiddle to the overall psychological problems of the addict . billy crudup is simply ingenious in this sterling role as the poetic voice of the author , making the internal musings of denis johnson's disjointed surreal stories come to life , not quite like in the book , but in its own cinematic way . that this impossible book was adapted to the screen , is a minor miracle itself , though it is certainly not a fault-free film , as it petered out toward the end from sluggishness . but if viewed as a story that doesn't have to make too much sense , because a junky' life doesn't make too much sense anyway , then the film can be savored for its fair quota of highs . the film is divided into chapter headings , which are flashed onscreen , as fh rants on like the stoned out freak he is . there might be some unintentional moral to the story at this point , as they both take the heroin but wayne keels over dead from it . " jesus' son , " a title snatched from a lou reed song , has many glorious moments of dry humor , pungency , sadness and unpredictability ; it exhibits the rare quality all special films have , it requires some effort to see what the film is about , and though it is a likable film , it does not aim to please its audience . it is a film that zig-zags all over the map , with its target being pop culture in america and how one survivor of the drug culture , who is so disarming and real , will have his maddening story breathe life into his messed up junkie veins and give vent to dreams he has that are as relevant as any genuine religious experience . 
it featured a young cast , hungry to make its mark in films . this surprisingly realistic war drama , caught a dark side to the war in a very personal way that very few films have captured . the film had the same gritty feel to it that sam fuller's " the steel helmet " had , but the emphasis here is more on a psychological nature than fuller's cultural one . endore is one of those people who can't live by the rules , considering them to be mostly unnecessary . on a personal level , the psychological effects of the war are seen through the conflict between loomis and endore . the sheer black-and-white photography caught the expansive mood of the troops in the battlefield , and its grainy quality helped the viewer see the war in a personalized way , as in the scene where the idealist loomis is fighting for his survival in a hand-to-hand fight with a chinese soldier . this is a wonderfully maddening film . there couldn't be a more pronounced statement about the insanity of war than this gritty film offers , as seen mainly through the dead-pan eyes of a psychopath . 
a strangely intriguing , darkly made psychological allegory based on the late walker hamilton's only novel . it is the directorial debut film of jeremy thomas , the producer of bertolucci , roeg , and cronenberg films , and the husband of the screenwriter eski thomas . the film works its way to a suspenseful but tacky and implausible revenge conclusion , as all its energy seems to have been spent on its fairy tale setup and the relationship between the two kindred spirits . but , nevertheless , this film , if you allowed it to be seen as a proficiently lyrical work , one that is heartfelt and never false , then you can feel the sincerity of it and you can see in the grand shots of bobby's escape to the wilderness , away from civilization , as he earnestly narrates his tale of woe offscreen , how poetical the film is and how it is a modern fairy tale for adults and fans of the cinema that still believe that movies can make them see things again as they did when they were children . 
abbas kiarostami's brilliantly perceptive film is based on a true story , but is done in mock-documentary style . this slow-moving , temperately structured film , shot in the cin ? ma-v ? rit ? style so that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is reconstructed , has a curious fascination about it . he just reads books on film and has never worked on one before , but always wanted to be a director . he also looks somewhat like the director , but not enough to fool anyone who has ever seen what the director looks like . the film has a somewhat curious aesthetic feel to it , as the director's motivations seem to be largely a test for the audience to see if they really know what they are getting from their experience in viewing a film . all those who testify , tell the truth from their own viewpoint , as some of the dialogue is pleasingly witty and some of the observations made are extremely sharp . at the film's conclusion , kiarostami wants to make sure that we know it is only a film , as he has the pardoned sabzian return with flowers to the home of mr . ahankhah . the director forces us to be alerted that what we are seeing is not real life , and that it is made possible only through technology . he is not a criminal in the sense of what we think a criminal is , and this compelling film lets us think of him in whatever way we want to , as we watch this film as viewer , judge , and jury . the marvelous thing , is that kiarostami can get superb performances from the non-professional actors as well as the professionals , because as sabzian stated during the trial , acting is just being yourself , letting it all come out from the heart . this is just a wonderful film , with kiarostami's humor prevailing . it is also an interesting look at modern iran , its bureaucracy , its class divisions , its high unemployment , and its seemingly fair-minded court system . 
apple , the ( sib ) ( director : samira makhmalbaf ; screenwriter : mohsen makhmalbaf ; cinematographer : ebrahim ghafouri/mohamad ahmadi ; editor : mohsen makhmalbaf ; cast : massoumeh naderi , zahra naderi , ghorbanali naderi , azizeh mohamadi ; runtime : 85 ; 1998-iran/france ) it is based on a true event and uses the actual family involved in relating this odd but wonderful story , which is told in a wryly humorous manner . this ignorance is bliss tale , a tale with no given solution , seems like it is a documentary , but instead it mixes fact and fiction , as it adds setup fictional pieces to its factual story ; and , this national story in iran , which was widely reported in their media causing a national scandal , plays here with a dazzling sense of wonderment and complexity . it makes a potent statement about women's rights in a country where women are seen as inferior , and it also symbolically calls for more freedom for all people . 
the family is more complex than a mob family has a right to be , and the philosophical lines they spout , in this slow-moving , almost actionless film for this genre , sometimes seems bizarre but has a strange pull to it , one that keeps you wondering what's going on with these dangerous criminals , as their lives begin to unravel during the funeral . this is the most powerful scene in the film and it is brilliantly accomplished . but the film can't end on that prosaic note , this film is heading down a more philosophical and catholic path , as the end is so unexpected and makes so little sense , no matter how you try to explain it , that we can only guess what the director means . the picture works despite the bizarre ending , because it is gritty and seems real , in the sense that so many families are dysfunctional in america , that there is no reason why a long-standing mob family shouldn't also be plagued with family problems . chris penn's performance earned him the " best supporting actor " award at the 1996 venice film festival and the film won the special jury prize . but i didn't think he was something special , as much as he gave the film energy . the gallo character , despite a lot of attention placed on it , is never uncovered , and his performance only seemed adequate . he has a great line , though , where he says , " life is pointless without the movies . " i thought the glue to this film , was walken's mesmerizing performance , who is able to say with a straight face , that the flaw in a criminal's character , is that he is not trustworthy . he and his wife are the only characters that i really felt for , who seemed to be touching something deep down and bringing it up for examination . that is the message ferrara brings with this anti-gangster gangster film , who digresses to talk about other topics such as capitalism and sexual kinkiness , but only in a cursory way . the film has a black humor to it and a dark side that is darker than the typical 1940 noir films were . the emotions here are allowed to run over the screen and , all the diversions to the plot and even the plot itself , are not as important as delving into the emotional make up of the lead characters . it is an engrossing film , one of the better gangster films , even though it is flawed by the director's inability to stay in focus and maintain a coherent narrative . 
this debut indie film for director steven soderbergh is a stimulating but perverse psychological drama . the film is invasive sexually , but not in an explicit way , as there is no nudity and the film eschews sensationalism for an honest verbal character study . it is more interested in telling about the gulf between what is felt and what is perceived , as the main characters try to articulate what is at the root of their problems . at the cannes film festival , this low budget film , made for about $1 . 2 million , deservedly won la palme d'or for best film and the best actor award for james spader . this is much more than a voyeuristic film , as everything becomes personal . the script is intelligent ; the acting is superb ; and , the director has elicited spontaneous and natural performances , weaving it into a film where having a conversation about masturbation is as natural as talking about the weather . this is a film where sex is always kept as an intriguing mystery and a part of the story that adds spice to the wry humor of the events . and the trophy wife , can only respond , " i like the stability and john's promotion . " all the sexual ambiguity they both have for each other changes into a real liking they have for each other and an acceptance of how they are damaged goods but have the possibilty of changing for the better . the clever story becomes very emotionally satisfying , even if it ties things up a little too neatly . 
i enjoyed this film much better than when i first saw it in a theater many years ago , as i watched this b/w noir thriller recently on tmc and got a better feel for this fugitive on-the-run film , one that spawned a new genre . delmar daves , the writer/director , has done a more than credible job in catching the tense atmosphere involving the characters and the san francisco locale . the film is almost stolen by bizarre performances by both agnes moorhead as the nosey madge , and by clifton young as baker , the small-time hood with the crooked smile and the even more crooked heart . parry is never seen , as we only hear his voice for about an hour into the film , seeing a picture of him only in the newspaper as an escapee , as he tells his tale from his subjective viewpoint . the hard-lucked parry hitches a ride with the much too inquisitive baker . the use of the first person point-of-view camera through the film's first thirty minutes , was interesting and actually better done than the use of such a similar camera gimmick in " lady in the lake , " which did it an year earlier . what makes this noir slightly different than others , is that bogart's troubles are from external matters , not from his own character flaws , like in most noir film . the fatalism commonly developed in the internal structures of most noir protagonists , is just not relevant to the bogart character , who ends up in a happy relationship with the one he loves , anyway . 
say anything . . . first-time director cameron crowe who was to go on and make many successful films ( singles/jerry maguire ) , including his latest " almost famous , " gives his due respect to these teenage characters , whose character are rarely treated in such films in such a plausible human way . that alone is enough to make this a superior film , but besides that , the film was superbly scripted and acted , with tremendous use of the characters interacting in a real way . finally , we have a teen film that doesn't dumb down its story line and play it as a goofy teen film . the important thing here is that everyone was presented in a real way , even the irs agents were given more than one dimension , and therefore it meant something to see how the relationship between the teenage couple developed . 
but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as " aliens " and " the fly ( 86 ) , " but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself . 
first time director/writer khyentse norbu has created a pleasingly gentle comedy with pressing political undertones . it is genuinely acted by the nonprofessional cast living in the monastery , presumably playing roles of themselves . khyentse norbu , the bhutanese-born lama , has more in mind than just making pictures like his favorite director ozu does . . . as he seems more intent in telling about overcoming hatred in oneself , which is deemed as the buddhist way to overcome all one's enemies . the cup was a crowd favorite at the toronto film festival , which is easy to see why , in a film that tries very hard to bring the stern monastic world of the monks together with a more lighthearted secular approach to the modern conditions the monks are now faced with . the story is a true one , which should add relevancy to this very human , amusing and poignant tale . geko will join him , wondering why he's not watching the game , since he made such a big fuss about it . it's a small but telling story , more european in flavor than american , but deserving of much praise for its heartening universal human message . the film itself , makes no splash cinema-wise , as its story is told in a conventional art-house style . but this film has ingrained in it more than merely its inspirational story , it is a film about a culture that is currently being persecuted and threatened with genocide , and the noble tibetan answer is to fight back by being as a human as possible , not resorting to violence , only acting in the most civilized way possible , making their actions , no matter what they are involved in , a moral lesson to the world . this film utters such a human cry against oppression and even in the lighthearted style that it was presented , its political message about the meaning of freedom is nevertheless an urgent one , one well-worth listening to and not turning away from the film with a cynical knee-jerk reaction , by complaining as to how plain the story is . if that's all you see about this film , a bunch of kids watching a soccer game on satellite tv , then i think you missed its message in this lifetime . 
though kitano has strong feelings for them , probably reminded through them of his own unsteady youth , he nevertheless doesn't let them off the hook , showing their many faults and blemishes , and their immaturity and lack of discipline that is needed to succeed . this is one of the better boxing/troubled teenager movies i have seen , very much in the style of those old warner brothers bogie films . there is a freshness and a spark in it that is very easy to feel . these were characters placed in situations where they are still so young , that their current downfall does not necessarily mean curtains for them . kitano continues to make offbeat films that are packed with a wallop . this film has his same intense rhythms and visuals as his other great gangster films , but it is less violently graphic . the director is so confidant of what he is doing that the character of shinji shines ever so strongly , despite long periods of him remaining quiet . kitano's unique gift is in his understanding of the troubled youths and in his humorous presentation of them , one that is given with a gently bemused but forgiving look at how the teens do such stupid things as kids . a most interesting and perceptive film . 
a purely hollywood hokum story of the lycanthropy legend , but done with much gusto and fun . the cast is superb , the atmosphere of an english village with an alpine background setting and plenty of fog and dense woods , gives the film an eerie look . the dialogue is spellbinding at times . the film covers all angles about werewolves , as curt siodmak's original script is so believable that films ever since have used the nonsense he perpetrated here as the absolute gospel for horror films . gwynn was too far away to see what happened . " thewolf man " is some kind of special b-movie , it works so well , even if the story is impossible to believe , because of the stellar cast and that there is a modern link between the wolfish desires of the lon chaney character and how society can't help itself today in the same psychologically wolfish way as the wolf man was trapped in . the film had an undeniable special quality about it that imbued it with a lasting magic . this one's a classic , one of the greats in the horror genre . 
an astute political film about an idealistic liberal lawyer concerned with community grass roots issues . the film is so realistic , probably , because it was written by a senator eugene mccarthy speechwriter jeremy larner , who won the oscar for his original screenplay . it is directed by michael ritchie ( downhill racer ) , who does a good job keeping the film afloat with black humor and tension . it thankfully never sinks into melodrama because it stays with the campaign without padding on an unnecessary plot . the only difficulty i had with the film , is that it is not easy to parody the political scene , which is already a parody of itself . this intelligent film shows that better than any other political film i have seen thus far : it magnifies what the seduction of power can do to someone , even an idealist like the redford character . the candidate , though , compromised , still remains a somewhat ambiguous sympathetic figure , someone who still might be effective as a senator , even though he is flawed . which supposedly means , for the moment , what do you have to lose , just be yourself , no one expects you to win . the change in mckay's message is not without misgivings on his part , but what the film does well is keep the focus on the campaign . he also energizes the apathetic electorate with basically the same tired political rhetoric his opponent is saying , but he has charisma and it somehow sounds fresh coming from his lips . it would be too easy to blame it on the system , which this film correctly doesn't do . this hollywood film has passed the test of time and is still a good watch , especially , during an election year . and , even though the times have changed from the 1970s , the political process still looks the same , if that is possible to believe . 
agnes varda's first color film is shot in very warm and pleasing pastel hues , capturing the beautiful french countryside and the ordinary dwellings where the family featured resides . the mozart playing in the background instills a dream-like magic into the lush natural settings . what makes this film somewhat unique , is that jean-claude drouot's real wife and kids portray his movie spouse and offspring . marital bliss cannot be more idyllic than as it is shown on this picnic . spoiler to follow : if you don't want to know the main event in the story , skip the next paragraph and go on to the last paragraph . this is a very sensual and visually satisfying film , one that shows how each of the characters is stuck in their own romantic dream-world . it might not have a very absorbing tale to tell , but it packs a more deep-seated emotional charge than what might appear at first glance . 
spoiler to follow : skip to last paragraph if you don't want to know the details of harry's investigation . this is the best film that arthur penn has done . the acting is thoughtfully and purposefully carried out . hackman's characterization of this is superb . this excellently scripted film by alan sharp , captures the mood of the country at the time among many who felt they survived vietnam , the jfk assassination and the white house scandal , but still feel weary and uncertain about the future , as it seems as if no matter what they do or how smart they become , they are still going around in circles . it is sort of like playing the grand master in chess and you know what move to trap him , but you still screw up somehow and lose . 
an iconoclastic biopic about the adventurous 17th century late-renaissance painter michelangelo merisa da caravaggio , who was born in 1573 and died in 1610 . the baroque artist is superbly played by nigel terry and the story is brilliantly adapted to the screen by english director derek jarman . it is very sensually done , emphasizing the artist's gargantuan appetites for bisexual and , especially , homosexual affairs with his models , the various scandals he was involved in--including murder , his tricky dealings with the church , and the director's playful anachronisms , purposefully including in his film the modern street sounds as background . successfully filmed on a very restricted budget , which only proves , if you know how to shoot a film , you can do it on shoestring budget and still come up with an outstanding film . his original way of shooting a biopic ( highly personal but still factual ) , whereby caravaggio's most famous works are recreated with actors who are filmed in a style true to caravaggio's chiaroscuro paintings ( the artist's gift to the art world ) , makes for a one of a kind film . jarman creates an inspiring visual atmosphere for nigel terry's brooding artist portrayal , of the artist on his death bed . this art house film , a classic in gay cinema reaching out to a mainstream audience , the director's most accessible film , was winner of the silver bear at the 1986 berlin film festival . that this film should make us concerned about this intemperate artist , which is not an easy task to do , is accomplished despite telling us as little about him as possible , but letting us instead examine him and his paintings in exacting detail by using close-ups and by making his death watch a solemn scene , befitting a giant of a man passing before mere mortals . the film captures the turbulent nature of the artist , accurately showing his inventive art technique ( the basis for current movie lighting techniques ) , and it relates how the low birth artist still had so much anger in him even as he grew in status and how he always painted in such a feverish pitch , always the passionate artist . the film also lets us see how he can so easily kill someone he loved because he believed he was doing something that was just . as a result this is a dark but imaginative look at the artist , one that has weight to it and works very well , which should be more pleasing to art lovers than the general public . 
this is sam peckinpah's masterpiece . the opening scene highlights peckinpah's theme of man's inherent violent nature from childhood and points to the bloodshed that will come in the film's payoff , as he shows a bunch of mexican children poking a stick at a writhing scorpion being devoured by killer ants and of them laughing as they watch . thereby the memorable closing scene , which is a picture of pure violence as an answer to everything , as the generalissimo's men and pike's remaining men shoot it out , leaving no survivors . they don't make violent westerns like this one anymore , but they tried to imitate it many times , but they could never quite capture the spirit that this classic western had . 
it is superbly acted and photographed , and even if the irwin shaw short story the film is adapted from seems aimless , there is a poignancy that rings true underlining the inscrutability of the characters . since a one-night stand didn't materialize , the boys forget about the nice girls . 
lewton's fingerprints are all over the literary script that was made into an intelligent , well-crafted and bizarre thriller . it is noirish in attitude and gothic in tone , enhanced by dark shadowy cinematography and mark robson's crisp direction , which brings about a mixture of ominous danger and a feel for the offbeat . it opens with a grim john donne poem to set the stage for the upcoming action , " i run to death , and death meets me as fast , and all my pleasures are like yesterday . . . " . it's easy to dismiss the film's flaws , such as cramming too much story into such a short time frame of 71 minutes , but it is better to concentrate on the artfully told b-film and all the personal touches found that make the film so clever . when viewed that way , this low-budget film is simply superb , equal to producer val lewton's " cat people " ( 42 ) . for its time period of the 1940s , it bravely touches on suicide as a necessary part of the plot and covers satanic cults in a mature manner , by showing that ordinary types can join such a cult . 
an enjoyable , witty hollywood satire from director-writer david mamet , who presents a sharp comedy that rails against his own acting community , but says they're no different than any small community in america . if you love snappy dialogue , characters who are insightful , and a healthy sprinkling of sheer playfulness you will find this film an old-fashioned delight , much like the sophisticated comedies of preston sturgess . it's a gift for fiction . " there is a running gag throughout the film from two stoic yankees , with lines that are pure mamet delights , as these two old-time vermonters who are nonplussed by all the fuss in town over the hollywood people have a dialogue that goes like this : woodchuck #1 : " it takes all kinds . " woodchuck #2 : " that's what it takes ? i always wondered what it took . " the greatness in the film , is that it was hysterically funny and it kept me laughing for the entire film , but it also was insightful , picking up on the hollywood phoniness and taking it for a nice ride through rural america . the film felt more stagy than cinematic , more apish of hollywood's cynicism than not , but that's ok , it still had some bite to it by way of some crisp dialogue and from some well-timed comedy routines . standing out from this fine ensemble cast was david paymer , who was priceless as the unscrupulous jewish stereotype of a hollywood figure , portraying asmarmy producer-lawyer ( perhaps only a witty jewish director such as mamet can get away with such a vile character depiction without being called to the carpet for it ) . philip seymour hoffman , who never fails to give a great performance , is here asked to carry the film's theme of whether he can carry out a convenient lie to save his hollywood career or is he just an old-fashioned guy who can't lie worth a damn . william h . macy nearly had me rolling in the aisle with his quick-witted delivery and nonstop diatribes . 
mystery of mr . it is a witty , well crafted thriller , that has a charm to it that sparkles like a diamond . the mystery of mr . x was remade in 1952 as the hour of thirteen . 
in this minimalist tale , the two are interviewed separately by an unseen jacques viala , who could never get either one of them to reveal their fantasy , and what's more , they sometimes had different impressions about the affair . interestingly , this is a very steamy story , but the sex is not explicit . . . as we also see that they are both sensitive , intelligent and respectable people . it was a great bedroom lovemaking scene , which was intimately done with both humor and passion . but the viewer , unable to know more than the little he sees about them , can only guess at what draws them so close . the story played more like a gimmick than a real love affair , because after their initial encounters , it seemed rather strange that these intelligent people wouldn't be curious to know more about each other , especially since they were developing a certain bond together . yet , on the other hand , the reason this film worked so well , was the illuminated performance by baye , who was 50 at the time of the film , but looks much younger and has such a touching quality about her , that she is simply ravishing . and if you add to that the mature script by french novelist and playwright philippe blasband and the classy way frederic fonteyne directed , it is easy to see why the film was so enthralling . what you get is an affair that turns out to be in surprisingly good taste , but without satisfying the more mundane matters in a relationship . it was as if this was a sex lab experiment , an ideal couple was being tested to see if a purely sexual encounter could spark a more intimate relationship . if the film moved off its experimental mode and let us see the couple act away from the controlled ground rule conditions , this might have been an even much better film . the film was originally titled " une liaison pornographique . " it won for best film at venice . 
a poignant , original , psychological drama-comedy depicting life among a bunch of disorientated residents in vancouver . his schoolwork also suffers because of his deep sexual problem . he makes good use of leigh's improvisational way of shooting a film and has created a nifty contemporary film , with frighteningly real sex scenes and recognizable characters who have modern urban problems . the acting is subtle ( babz chula's performance is mesmorizing ) , while , the story , though not reliant on plot , is emotionally strong , showing how all the individuals are tangled up in knots . it was both a sad and funny picture , one that i would highly recommend for those who are not afraid of seeing some very graphic , 'dirty' sexual scenes , that fit the story to a tee . 
there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . 
this film offers a literate script and is sensitively directed , it's a brilliant debut as a director for playwright kenneth lonergan ( co-scripted " analyze this ! " ) . besides writing the screenplay and directing it , he also has a minor part in the film as a religious counselor . it is so well-conceived a work that it never feels stagy , as many other films of this type tend to be . the film was a co-winner of this year's sundance grand jury prize and recipient of the waldo salt screenwriting award . the siblings have different personalities and have gone down different roads , and even though there is a strong bond between them , what this restaurant meeting highlights is how different they also are , as this scene brilliantly sets the tense tone for the remainder of the film . the sheer beauty in the film is in the natural bonding that develops between the curiously bright but lonely rudy and the irresponsible terry . the bad decisions terry makes are not selfish ones , but are the one's he makes because he means well but doesn't always know how to do the right thing . sammy and rudy touch something about themselves in terry's short summertime visit , something they wouldn't have touched that was so real without terry being there as a catalyst for change . this subtle drama is satisfying in almost every respect , but mainly as a realistic presentation of working-class characters who are struggling with the mundane problems of everyday existence . this is a superbly acted and subtle work , whose only flaws are in the unbelievable romance between boss and worker and the artificial lovemaking depicted between sammy and her townie boyfriend , both of which had no ring of truth to it . but , otherwise , this is one of the best films of 2000 , and indie type of art film with an intensity and a strong sense of realistic dramatics that brings out the complex emotional problems of the main characters . 
art biopics are rarely successful ventures but this film approaches those high caliber art films , such as jacques rivette's la belle noiseuse and paul cox's vincent : the life and death of vincent van gogh , but falls short by a good country mile due to the film's inability to get a handle on how to tell about the taciturn artist's inner demons in a significant way rather than in the traditional bleak and trite way hollywood films usually illustrate an artist's failings . the strength of the film is in the tour de force performances of both ed harris as the action painter pollock , a role that he is well-suited to play , and marcia gay harden's understated but brilliant performance as his brooklyn-born wife and main supporter , lee krasner . she won the oscar for best supporting actress , in a lengthy role where she was actually the co-star . but this is ed harris's film , a film he wanted to do as long as 15 years ago after reading a book about pollock and noticing from a photo how closely he resembled him and how he had a certain vibe for him . he not only directs and stars in the film , but he financed it . these scenes were brilliantly executed by harris and made the film a labor of love for him . harris was absolutely convincing playing the artist , he looked as if he was a real artist at work . pollock is not an overwhelming film , as much as it is a superbly well acted one . it shows how pollock found freedom only when he painted , as his outside life was that of a flawed man , a very difficult man to get along with , who didn't have much to say about art or life that was particularly interesting . harris as a director , had a love affair with the artist that was much too respectful to get beyond what we already know about him . he was someone who lived out the artist fantasy trip by achieving more in style than in substance , even though the film wants us to believe he was truly a great artist . 
the action takes place offscreen . some viwers might consider niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a noir , but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film , whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him , while the femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite . this was marilyn monroe's first starring role , after having been in already eighteen other films , but mostly in small roles . director hathaway does a nice job of crafting the film and exploiting its colorful location , but what he doesn't do that well , is allow the mystery part of the story to gracefully unfold . the last reel plays like an action film , with a strangulation , a kidnapping , a helicopter rescue , and one character doomed to be going over the falls . in contrast to the loomis' , the cutler's are seen as being a conventional couple , and the camera seems to be gently eyeballing them and showing that their sex life is calmer and more suited for a positive and loving relationship than the loomis' . yet the normal couple is attracted to the more exotic one , especially polly , through whose eyes the film is filtered out to us . 
an amusing and sophisticated espionage thriller , only slightly flawed by some of its contrivances . he's a disgraced m . i . -6 but andy is a go-getter , a schemer and an opportunist without scruples . geoffrey rush is the timid man trapped in the post-noriega panamanian intrigues , and pierce brosnan is the seducer without morals . they play one another off in a most refreshingly joyous way , as for a while is hard to tell who has the upper hand . under john boorman's ( deliverance/hope and glory ) competent direction , the film has air to breathe for its smart storytelling tale and parody . the joke is how readily the americans buy into this unreliable info without thoroughly checking it out , and how this quickly turns into an international disagreement between panama and the u . s . . this farce works out fairly well . the script is tight . the directing is impeccable , the acting finely tuned , and the mood it sets is for a thinking man's picture to develop amidst all the comedy . the digs i liked best were : 'you know what the poor call those ? ' launderettes ! ' this is not an ordinary commercial formula film , but it's more like harry's handmade suits rather than those suits bought off the rack . 
this wonderful documentary on the life of ramblin' jack elliott won the special jury award for artistic achievement at the 2000 sundance film festival . the film's other aim is a loving tribute to his musical accomplishments and his troubadour lifestyle of never settling down . she complains : " the thing is , i can't remember having an actual conversation with my dad . " 
it is adapted from herman melville's 1852 novel pierre ( pola is the acronym of the french title of melville's novel , x stands for the tenth draft of the screenplay which writer/director leos carax completed ) . it is a film about madness and excesses , topics that are always fuzzy to portray on the screen . it's set in modern france though it starts out looking like a romantic 19th century literary work , where its background is a rich , idyllic country setting in normandy of palatial chateaus void of modern traffic . we know it's modern times only because the protagonist rides a motorcycle and uses a computer . this is a unique film , that has an inexplicable brilliance to it that defies reason and its soap opera melodramatics . it is precious film , though parts of it may not be pleasing or deciferable . but there is an intelligence it has about it that should overcome all doubts about its excesses : as the film goes from showing pierre's change from being a self-indulgent aristocrat to his complete breakdown as a self-indulgent raving lunatic . 
this story is very colorfully photographed and has very little dialogue . the final story is surreal and is very comical . marzieh meshkini is the wife of noted iranian film director mohsen makhmalbaf . he served as the film's screenwriter . even though they are different women depicted , it might as well be the same woman because the film is a metaphor for all iranian women . strangely enough , the iranian censors wanted the director to cut this part because they found it too erotic . we know exactly how she feels and how determined she is not to be bullied by them , as we clearly see her animated facial expressions . in any case , it is evident from this episode that a divorce can be attained quite easily by a man . this is an irresistible film . i ate it up as quickly as i used to lick an ice cream cone when i was a kid . you can learn more about iran from watching a movie like this one than you can by following the news stories reported by the media . 
they keep the viewer riveted to the twists in plot as one's perceptions about the case are subject to change , in this excellently conceived australian psychological thriller . what is the truth can only be surmised by the film's end , but enough is revealed so that you think you know the answer . though the film might not be startling or flamboyant it is competently acted , especially by the two main antagonists , hugo weaving and tony martin . it is chillingly photographed by simon duggan , giving it a retro-noir film look . 
love's a bitch is an intricate film noir tale , living up to its tough sounding title . it's a melodrama about violence and passion in a contemporary mexican city . this compelling , lengthy ( 153 minutes ) drama is alejandro gonz ? lez i ? ? rritu's auspicious directorial debut . the lost dog sequence seemed too forced and heavy-handed to have much impact ; it was piling up the material girl's misery much too high . there's passion and excellent filmmaking and acting in these gritty stories , but there's also too much of a story going on ; and , it is too long of a film . but it is intoxicating in its edginess and harsh look at reality , and at one's dreams and obsessions . i ? ? rritu's characters are full of life and earthy flaws , and things that are too much for them to comprehend . an excellent debut film for the director , that touches in an original way on themes many other innovative indie directors ( especially quentin tarantino's pulp fiction ) are currently doing . 
a visually playful version of marcel proust's epic " remembrance of things past , " which only covers the last volume of a lengthy multi-volume book ; but , continually makes references to other parts of the book not covered in the film . the film is almost incomprehensible without reading the book , as there's no time to introduce all of the story line and characters ( though an attempt was made to introduce the main characters , as the dying proust puts a magnifying glass to the photos in his collection that bring back his memories ) ; for those who are not readers of the book this is not a substitute for the book , but a work that , nevertheless , lives on its own merits . to expect anything to be less than opaque from an undertaking of such a difficult work to adapt to the screen is , perhaps , asking too much of anyone . in a ruiz film one must expect a work that is obscure and mysterious . that this combination avant garde art film and literary period drama is successful in its bold attempt to go where most other filmmakers fear to go , into the labyrinthian world of proust's dying era during the early part of the 20th century and to come away with a work of such dreamlike beauty , is simply an amazing feat . it's a film that doesn't necessarily tell a story , but brings you instead to the conclusion of " remembrance of things past " in an unforgettably eccentric way . in this dying atmosphere marcel will revisit his past , as the film is not linear so we will see him as he was throughout his life -- from a youngster to middle-aged to his present condition -- at any time during the film . the film is made up of a succession of formal social gatherings in palatial homes through which finely dressed women gossip wearing either brocades or fashionable feathers sticking out of their hair ; while the formally dressed men parade around in the ballroom with the look of contented bulls ; the film's most artistic image is of the men's upturned top hats covering the floor of an ornate waiting room . we are treated to funerals as spectacles that look oddly enough like convivial affairs . madame verdurin's companion replies : " but you're wrong , odette looks ravashing . " the film is loaded with surprises , as ruiz uses proust in the film to meditate on how he would have used the film if he were to film his epic instead of write it . there are all sorts of camera tricks used : shots frozen in time , imitations of how the filmmakers of that time period shot their films , and the past and present fuse sometimes together in a surrealistic way . it's an ambitious project , enhanced by its starry cast , filled with splendid visuals and tidbits from conversations that don't linger long , as the film moves intractably into the poetical . it's proust you're getting , but from a daring perspective . this is not a film to see only once . it is also a rare film , that shouldn't be missed , even if it's messy and one is apt to get lost in its decadent mood swings and enthralling aristocratic atmosphere . the film just feels right for either the reader of the novel as i was some 30 years ago who was trying to recall what i could from the book as i watched , or the novice to proust who might just be entertained by what he or she sees on the screen . there are some who claim that this is the best written novel of the 20th century , and it very well might be ! this film works , despite being able to only capture the book in spirit but not in its whole . but there is no doubt about one thing , this is what good filmmaking is about ! 
it traces in particular the aspects of women's work and their servitude that covers a 10-year period - from 1951 to 1961 . it is seen through the eyes of mui . because of this the young child tin , in particular , acts unruly , taking it out mostly on mui . the second part of the film pales in comparison to part one , and that is because the innocent mui as a child was the glue that held the film together and made it seem so special . the older mui doesn't radiate the same warmth on the screen . this is a very pleasing and subtle tale about the strength of the human spirit and the artistic quietude one has when finding peace within one's self . it is about a traditional culture that is no longer common , if it exists at all , since the vietnam war . a terrific film , one of tremendous visual beauty , but one that steers clear of any overt political messages . at cannes , it was named the best film by a first-time director . it also received a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars . 
it's a metaphysical love story with a bit of mystery thrown in . there's also more than a bit of a political allegory to it that holds the film together in an intelligent way , as both of the main characters are motivated by political concerns . the love story is complex and is the heart of this engrossing film , a film that deals with the ambiguities that propel people to be who they are . it's a relationship filled with all sorts of possible pitfalls . billy crudup plays the wheedling fielding pierce who's stuck in an empty world of deceit , in a political role much like the robert redford character in the candidate . in fielding's case he never shows that he's even a liberal , only that he's blinded by an urge to achieve success . he will never be quite sure if what he envisioned was real or a figment of his desires , but his sanity at this point is certainly questionable . she states : " i want a life that makes sense . " i don't really know how great this film is , but it did catch my attention ; especially , the way gordon was able to get his main characters to act out who they were and struggle to make their life and their love viable , despite the different directions they would have to go to get where they wanted to be . there was something soap opera like about this tragic love affair that was not only baffling but sad , yet it was more dramatic than that . we weren't overwhelmed by them as stereotypes , forced into accepting them . i think how we accepted them really relates to our life experiences . i know i felt very comfortable with jennifer connelly's performance ; i thought it was subtle , soft-spoken , and unforgettably powerful . it was easy for me to relate to her and what she was about without feeling i was presented with a character who was being foisted on me in a " love story " tear-jerker way . the film was passionate , intelligent , and real . the jennifer connelly character is really the subject of the film and her spirit fills the screen whether she's on it or not . this is because she came across as someone with a real heart and is always haunting us throughout the film because we care about her . we don't really care about him . the two actors were just terrific , giving the story its potency and purpose . 
it's an homage to robert altman's insightful film , with the same theme , " mccabe and mrs . miller . " they have come here to confront mr . dillon in a way that will not call attention to others why they are here . dalglish is the young scottish version of dillon . it all indicates that even though he's honestly doing his job , he seems to be someone who has chinks in his armor and might in the future be more easily corrupted . the claim works best as an antitraditional western epic that presents an allegorical drama of fate , retribution and redemption . it took a certain courage for dillon , the flawed hero of the story , to come out to this barren land and make something out of it . the next generation to come out here was represented by the brashness of young dalglish , who will have it easier than the pioneers . he will have more to work with , but the baton has been passed on and he will also have to face his dark side and see if he can overcome his mistakes and build something that is worthwhile and lasting . the film might not have been engaging dramatically at all times , as it parcelled out its long tale reluctantly in bits and pieces , but it sets a haunting mood relating the lives of these laconic characters to the building of the country . the film is satisfying because it remains elusive as to what the ingredient for success and happiness is , as each character wants something else in their american dream . this is a country where individual freedom is cherished , and this film does that concept a great honor by not trivializing that dream to be the same for everyone . there are a number of striking visual scenes ; such as , the train passing through the breathtaking mountain landscape , which indicates what a difficult chore it must have been to lay tracks in that location . the scottish actor peter mullen gave a wonderfully restrained performance , convincing as the man who did wrong and doesn't know how to make things right except by trying to when given a second chance . there's a gloomy ending that reflects on how disasterous and empty a life of greed is . it's a bleak film that manages to give one hope for a situation that seems hopeless , and that is the strength of this very enriching film . it has captured a slice of the american west from a book that was written as an english period piece . 
here jaoui takes on the directing duties as well . the charm in this plot less film is that everyone presented is so much different in lifestyle and yet with all their flaws and differences , they all have something going for them that might be appealing to someone else . the story allows us to see each of their points of view clearly as their character is fully developed ; it is so smartly and subtly done without patting itself on the back , that it becomes a pleasure to watch such an intelligent presentation on the problems of love and of one developing taste . and , isn't life all about developing taste and evolving ! the more limited one is , the more limited one's friendships and love will be ! the performers all do a marvelous job of getting this across and they make the film a joy to see . it's thankfully a film that has a life of its own and shuns any formulaic way of resolving this tale , which should only disappoint zombie viewers of familiar hollywood love stories . 
stanley kubrick until his untimely death was working on a project that weighed for a long time on his mind -- the subject of artificial intelligence . steven spielberg is given the blessing by the kubrick estate to take over that project , and he brings his great craftsmanship skill as a visual story teller to the film while paying homage to kubrick's intentions and themes he wanted developed . he succeeds for most of the film in keeping it tight while presenting an occasional riveting psychological moment or two , as he tells a fairy tale for adults ; it's a version which will go way over the heads of children and many of the adults . what he does is put the pinocchio fairy tale , the frankenstein story , and the oedipus myth in his warm-hearted blender and gives them a good mixing up . he also takes full credit for the script and does not include kubrick as co-screenwriter ; he only credits him with the film's idea . what spielberg fails to do is tell the fairy tale ending in the same artistic way a kubrick would have displayed his mastery of telling a good mystery story . it was a thoughtful climactic touch but what the film demanded for it to be considered as a masterpiece , is a more lyrical note to end it on ; which is the most glaring fault of the film . what spielberg delivers is a film that leaves you thinking about what the end of human civilization means and how close to artificial intelligence can the world be as its reality , and about how love is something that can't be programmed without something being amiss about it . it also does not have spielberg's usual dosage of sentimentality , which has played havoc with most of his previous films . it's a splendid film that pays homage to both himself and kubrick for their noteworthy films . t . . it's a hollywood film that defies what a hollywood film is about , while in essence still being a hollywood film of excesses and special effects . this is one of the best films spielberg has ever made , and his most thought-provoking one . it has much of both giant filmmakers locked into this story , though it's a spielberg film and not a kubrick one . a . i . is set in the near-future , mid-21st century , as narrator ben kingsley explains that the melted ice caps are a common sight . the sight of nyc submerged under the ocean is both bleak and visually satisfying . what is hinted at , is that we are just beginning to see what the possibilities there are in a . i . . but in order for the robots to have a live intelligence and not merely a programmed one , they will have to be created like nature creates its plants and animals . it is this possibility that will always leave them flawed , but with the potential to push evolution to new levels . the second half of the story becomes layered with more complex themes and harder to answer questions . it's a spiritual odyssey about creation that david takes in the hardened nocturnal world of what remains of urban civilization , which is a reflection of a literary hell . it's here that spielberg asks questions about humanity that he has never asked before in his more lightweight films : he questions family values and wonders about scientific and religious definitions of creation , and he most of all wonders if humanity is only one link in evolution that raises consciousness and that if it becomes obsolete what will be the other ways to evolve . it's an imaginative film , that has a lot going for it except exciting dialogue . i couldn't ask for anything more from spielberg ; he has taken on kubrick's depth and artistic integrity in filmmaking , at least , for this film ; he has paid homage to kubrick , and has made a highly personal film . this might disappoint many in the mass market audience that are attracted to spielberg for other reasons and might expect to see another kiddie pic like e . t . . but the film will also attract a more sophisticated sci-fi film crowd , that should connect this film with a " 2001 " cyberspace experience . 
a brilliantly stylized period piece set in kyoto in 1865 , during the final days of the samurais . it's written and directed by the great japanese filmmaker , nagisa oshima ( in the realm of the senses/empire of passion/merry christmas , mr . lawrence ) . taboo has a dreamlike quality to it that is spellbinding as it creates an eerie blue mood and makes the characters glow with a haunting feeling that this tale is taking place in the afterworld . kano is very appealing because of his boyish locks of hair and sensual and regal mannerisms , and his great ability as a warrior ; his stunning looks attracts everyone's attention . the film is an ambiguous one . its look at homosexuality is also a look at how others look at it , and what we know about that is seen in the expressions made . the film ends without a clarity to what kano or the commanders were going through internally . it's the closest we might come to decifering what all the ambiguity meant , as each one's perception might differ as to what beauty is and what price they are willing to pay for it . a thoroughly maddening work from arguably japan's best living director . 
this is a film where the heroine could say with deep conviction that " i've seen bodies shining like stars , " and we believe her without laughing at her . it's an unusual and fascinatingly compelling fairy tale type of drama , steeped in feeling and intellect and romance . " kissed " is based on the original story by barbara gowdy " we so seldom look on love , " and directed with economy in her first feature by canadian lynne stopkewich . what makes this film standout , is that the subject matter is necrophilia . this is never followed up . but for sandra the dead bodies are a means of transcendence . . . the reason it's a detriment , is because her story is more dynamic and compelling than his . one of the really amazing things about ths film is that it's all believable . it's handled in a romantic and even comical way , allowing us to see the characters for what they are instead of sensationalizing their fetishes . there were three very good performances : jay brazeau sets a sobering tone for the story to be grounded in reality , no matter how far-fetched it may seem . peter outerbridge brings a sensitivity and restlessness to his role , as someone whose curiosity is so great that he's willing to try something that is ghoulish . but the film belongs to molly parker's absorbing translation of her role , as an ordinary person who is compelled to do what she feels most pressing inside her . the film comes with voice-overs from molly , in her quiet , gentle voice , and the photography at times becomes glowing in a heavenly whiteness or darkly pressing in a sobering blue shade . the film always felt dreamlike , like it was a fairy tale without a moral lesson to it . the film's only fault is in how slight the story is and how it failed to go beyond the shocking taboo point of its " crossing over " theme and really explore that untested subject matter in more depth . but the film is still a special one because of the freshness of its ideas , the originality of the film's theme , and the way it was so artfully filmed . 
it's a " message " film with " message songs " playing in the background , as its ultimate message is that it is better to live in peace and make the world a better place to live in then to blindly obey authority figures . the film's other aim is to show the lost dreams and violence that fills america's wastelands and wounds those living there . the main rivals of the cops are the hippies , as a clash over culture and values exists . the film is quirky , atmospheric , interesting in its character study , and is successful as a black comedy . it's main flaw is that its messages are too simplistic and the story suffers , at times , from a heavy-handed direction . the film has plenty of action scenes , culminating with a motorcycle chase ; a good twist in the murder mystery story ; and , what it does best is show how lonely people could be and how this is sometimes the driving force behind the false lives they lead . 
an auspicious debut for director joel coen and for the coen brothers as a writer and director team , as this film noir is delightfully thrilling . blood simple is highlighted by an absolutely wonderous performance that is both sleazy and diabolical by m . emmet walsh . made on a shoestring budget , the film sparkles because its characters are lively and quirky . i saw it on a recently digitally-remastered video version where the director cut off a few minutes of unnecessary dialogue . 
as a misleading clue , one page of the diary is left on the floor . 
it turns out that she didn't murder anyone , it was all the theater group's idea of testing out her skills as an actress in this real-life audition to see if she would get the part . it makes for a rousing climax , as karlson is good at doing the revenge thing in a crisp and rugged way . it's an absorbing film that holds your interest as it explores the life of people in the ring . it also covers the usual criminal types in a typical noirish way . it throws enough light and ideas around to make this a compelling film , better than your average film noir . its stylized violence and passion from the characters were both unreal and real , as the desperate characters grappled with the truth of their lives . 
the film was superbly shot in b & w by john alton in a semidocumentary style . it's a solid film noir effort , which was also able to get in some comments on social consciousness between the ethnic montalban and the snobbish bias the elitist edmon ryan portrayed . 
as is obviously intended , two can play that game is sure to hit big with the african american audience , but it should also be treasured as a great date movie for the moviegoing public at large . it's got the kind of friskiness that makes you exchange glances with the stranger seated next to you because both of you know how many things it gets right about relationships . with as many twists and turns as this romantic comedy takes , you're sure to have a good time . still , while the production contains all the correct ingredients , it uses them in the wrong recipe . it hits a humorous bulls-eye with plenty of cultural issues , but it lacks the very substance it's made of : true love . the film , written and directed by mark brown , makes a common hollywood mistake of confusing sexuality with true passion . not that this destroys the film ; in fact , for an r-rated sex comedy , this is very tame material . this production takes risks , but for a movie that concerns itself so much with romance , it just doesn't get any of that across convincingly . with frequent soliloquies , intrusive narration , and a central character that very much takes center stage , shante does not just narrate the film , she explains it . seldom do filmmakers gamble their success on such an unusual style , but the conceit gives the movie a sense of independence , attitude , and a unique , experimental flavor . fox's performance keeps energy alive , even when she knows her mouth is running a little too much . it's surprisingly entertaining . alas , the film does not really earn its ending . it doesn't persuasively prove the characters' sudden realizations . two can play that game is still light-hearted and fluffy . it exists solely to please the audience , but it also works as a social commentary . rating : * * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| 
an exciting film noir robbery escapade set in la , one that set the standard for such films . director richard fleischer shot the film in a taut manner , while the photographs of the dark la locale added grit to the film . 
it plays out as a horror comedy low-budget b-film that is a parody of the hip art world and those who seek fame . its satire cuts deeper into this bohemian world than most other films . walter is discovered by leonard as a murderer , but since collectors are willing to pay big bucks for such detailed realistic work--he doesn't tell the cops . charles b . griffith provides the film with a witty script . character actor dick miller gives an impressionable performance , as does his romantic interest barboura morris . it's a bloody black comedy that is gruesomely funny and because of its unsophisticated way of probing into the underground art world--it exudes a radiant charm , a true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras . 
black angel is a film noir armed with the following : a brilliant script by roy chanslor that is taken from a cornell woolrich novel , an engaging performance turned in by dan duryea who is in a rare role as someone sympathetic , and it is directed flawlessly with craft-like skills by roy william neill . this was duryea's first starring role after playing heavies . the film asks the question : is he a hero or a villain ? but he swears he didn't do it . the low-budget film had a stunning simplicity to it that evoked all kinds of feelings for the players involved in this imaginative story and dramatic tragedy . the film also presented an excellent character study of the dan duryea character , making him into a complicated black angel figure . 
a thoroughly delightful documentary by allan miller ( small wonders ) about the putting on of puccini's turandot opera . the china production features 900 hand-embroided costumes , made by 2 , 000 workers , that are authentic from the ming period . as an aside , we are told the soldiers thought the opera music at first sounded like mooing cows , but later on they began to enjoy it even humming some of the tunes . but the opera works as does the documentary , which is more about the intricacies of staging it then it is about the opera itself . the film could appeal to opera buffs as well as to those who never saw an opera , as it passionately shows the clashes of culture between the east and the west and differences about artistic ideas among the crew more than it does anything else . this seems to blend in perfectly with the opera being staged , which is also overblown with passion . " authenticity " is what makes zubin jump with rosy delight as his sense of artistic merit is realized by his moves to keep the production as a collaboration that is an international effort . he is most proud that it is being shown for the first time in beijing , the place the opera was originally set in . but zhang yimou looks sullen throughout , with a constant worry that something will go wrong in this unwieldy production and it will embarrass the chinese people . there's a for real clash with the italian director of opera lighting , guido levi , over the intensity of the light , which adds zest to the film . zhang , always the perfectionist , wants the bright lights to match those of the bright costumes , but only gets grief from the self-important italian . at one point zhang gives a coaches's football-like inspirational talk to some crew members saying : that he accepted the project " to win credit for the chinese , " and expects them to do well . it was also amusing to watch the overweight diva sharon sweet go into a snit about not wearing a tiny headdress because it made her look ugly . if not solved , the man is beheaded . there's some pieces of opera music played which were very pleasing ( such as the aria 'nessun dorma' ) . also interesting were the shots contrasting the opera setting in the ming dynasty with the routine life in modern beijing and its new hi-risers , and its citizens craving for consumer goods such as cell phones and tv's as they seem to be embarked on building a totalitarian style materialistic society . it was troubling not knowing anything about those tailors brought in to make the costumes--were they slave laborers ? nevertheless , it was amusing to learn of the differences of watching an opera in the west and in china . in the west , opera is treated as a very serious work and the theater remains quiet during the performance . mainly this is a film about what goes on backstage when you put on an opera , and that in itself was a treat to see . yet i didn't find these unpleasant incidentals damaging enough to interfere with zubin's aim to celebrate the different cultures by putting on this opera in beijing . zubin and miller had a different agenda than either the communist regime or for that matter zhang , and if the gap could be bridged through music that would be of benefit to world peace . 
a triumph of quirkiness over a hackneyed western story to make it a very appealing film that varies slightly from the genre . it was one of the best low-budget westerns that the noted director joseph h . lewis made in his long and distinguished career , as he chose to retire from the film industry with this film . there was some controversy surrounding this film as it was probably not good for anyone's career to appear in it , as many in the production were either blacklisted or were subpoenaed to appear before the house of un-american activities committee . it was skillfully made , had style and the expressions of an auteur filmmaker to make it standout from other westerns . 
luther robinson ) ; runtime : 95 ; fine line features ; 2000 ) it was produced on the low-budget of $6 million . if you don't think that was low , then compare it with this year's other musical " moulin rouge " and its $50 million budget . it was a poetically touching film , one that was more complex than what might have been thought from a work that calls itself a " post-punk , neo-glam rock musical . " the song becomes hedwig's rather unique theory of the evolution of human sexuality from a transsexual perspective . you can take it or leave it , but there it is to be heard as the cry of one voice telling of his own madness . i thought it was wonderfully vibrant , a chance to know about someone most of us will never meet either in life or through other films . an example of the lyrics he treats them to is " i rose from off of the doctor's slab/like lazarus from the pit/now everyone wants to take a stab/and desecrate me with blood , graffiti and spit . " this is the artful and alluring mr . mitchell's film all the way , as he puts his heart and soul into it both as a singer and an actor . he also wrote the screenplay and made his debut as a director . his rich voice sounds like david bowie' , using the songs written by stephen trask to fill the screen with a parody of bowie's ziggy stardust . he also struts across the stage as a super-star would , dons a multitude of wigs , lovingly shows off gams that are the equal of betty grable's , and captures our attention with his sad and meaningful story . it's one that calls out for tolerance in a spirited way , as it transcends pop culture and touches on the search the young have to find something in this world to believe in . this is something the film touched on in its teasing way , giving us something to chew over in this unusual tale . the film was both amateurish and glossy in a professional sense , and whatever it did--worked ; even using many gimmicky filmmaking techniques - including the stunningly gorgeous animated pieces by award-winning artist emily hubley . this is the best transvestite rock musical ever ( it got right both the music and the emotional impact of the pain suffered by the star ) , and it is at least better by an inch than its only other cult film rival " the rocky horror picture show . " though the latter will in all probability still be more popular with a wider audience . 
the film paints a grim picture of his family , though it's certainly not the worst family to raise kids . this impressive debut film is visually very powerful , it has plenty of images to relate to what's burning inside james . this audacious film seems like a nightmare , or a dream that james can't wake up from . the result is a lyrical work that has a numbing affect because of its sparseness and tight images ; it's a film of high quality . 
if you've seen max oph ? ls' reckless moment ( 49 ) , you've seen this film . it's the same story but updated to fit modern times . my take on remakes is--if it was a great film , as the 1940s noir film was , why make another ! but , at least , this version is as good . both matriarchs give oscar quality performances , in a film that is based on the novel by elizabeth sanxay holding called " the blank wall " and directed by the team who did suture--david siegel & scott mcgehee . it didn't convince me in the older version , nor does it in the newer ; but swinton as the perfect mom is convincing , as we see the determination and pain in her face as it is drawn tight in gaunt looks out at the world that has turned hostile for her . it's a moving but restraint performance and gives the art-house thriller some depth . 
les biches ( the does ) ( director : claude chabrol ; cast : jean-louis trintignant ( paul thomas ) , jacqueline sassard ( why ) , st ? phane audran ( fr ? d ? rique ) , henri attal ( rob ? que ) , dominique zardi ( riais ) , 1968-france ) this is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business . the film is divided into a number of segments that ask questions about the lead characters , questions they cannot readily ask about themselves . that chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters , each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them , plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common . it is a way to look at the 1960s , that is through the lenses of these materialists , who seemed to shun that period's more typical cultural revolution . by all indications , they could care less about art or the world . why knows she is not a good artist , and fr ? d ? rique could care less . though the sex is not explicit , its tenseness is what is felt as an obsession , as fr ? d ? rique and paul feel a happiness in their love that fills a void in their life that they couldn't find before . what makes this one of chabrol's better films , is the unexpected resources of the characters to pull off this emotionally draining story : the females , the very fragile does of the film , and the male , who is the hunter , wrestle with the ambiguities of their sexual intentions and inclinations , as it leads up to the tragic ending . their emotionally desperate situation always seems to be one step beyond their reach , as they get deeper and deeper into an unresolvable situation , with the film ending on its bleakest note , with a certain amount of vagueness still remaining , that is befitting a film that has told its story with all the style and clarity it could muster . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
can you imagine that this innovative , creative film , a groundbreaker for its time , managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director , as the subject's sexual content was too much to take for so many of the self-righteous critics of that time ! this is a film about scoptophilia ( voyeurism ) : the morbid urge to gaze , or as it is more commonly called , being a peeping tom . this fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by hitchcock or chabrol . its intensity and compelling characterization of mark , is a landmark in films . 
that ahmed goes on to the next village , despite warnings of not to go , is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed , if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant . the narrowness of life and the barren landscape , are excellent props for the director's vibrant themes , shot without professional actors and done in a low key , realistic style . the aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece , especially when you compare it to a satyajit ray film , but this is still great cinema , something american filmmakers would be wise to observe . his relentless pursuit is poetically evocative , depicting life in its raw elements . what more can you ask for ? 
this extra-ordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter , as the camera is held steadfast , not moving for insatiably long periods of time , picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion , as it looks at an oregon lumber mill , whose owner ( tom blair ) is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has built-up and worked at for his 50- odd years of life . by seeing who this man is , we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life , the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it , his easy and almost gentile manners , and his very definite american persona , as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises , and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual , who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others , so the closer we get to him , the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered . this scene could also be deemed as an attack on america's soul , exposing it to questions about truth and character , principles that are put under the microscope , as the story builds to its very tragic outcome . this is one of jost's deepest and most penetrating films , it could even be argued that he has made a classical film , as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story , replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting , that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature , that becomes a part of the people's own nature . one of the scenes that i found most memorable , was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear , at first , was the muffled conversations of the patrons , as the camera meticulously panned the diner , until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation , which became clearer , as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film . this time consuming shot , is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long non-action shot . this is one of jost's strong points , his willingness to explore territory others fear to go . jost's film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didn't clarify more precisely , but more importantly , it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with , as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world , as it asks . . . but , what does this mean if americans are not a happy people ? 
he did not like the service , saying he saw many terrible things there , so many dead people as a result of war , even though he was only a butcher there , it had an awful affect on him . this does not disturb our butcher , who comes by the school offering helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet . the most memorable scene in the film , is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll , when a red spot appears on it , looking like jam . that she doesn't say anything , but continues seeing popaul strikes me as odd . but this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story . the flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story , because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film , as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature . it is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between popaul and helene , but it is definetly not a sexual one . that was pretty much the theme chabrol used in his first film , shot 10 years before this one , le beau serge , which also took place in a rural village . but this time , the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured . this is chabrol at his best , equal to hitchcock . spinning an eerie psychological thriller , whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in , are painted with a master's elegant brushstrokes . it seems films such as this one , never get dated . it gets better every time i see it . this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background , the magnificent limestone caves , and the casual manner village life went on , giving this film a very natural atmosphere . as a result , this is a very satisfying film . 
something went terribly wrong and either party doesn't know what else to do . ian is very intense , almost over the edge , but he makes sense to these victims , and he requires no payment if he loses the case , but will be getting 1/3 of the settlement if he wins . this all adds up to a brilliant film . one of the best of the recent lawyer genre films now being made ( it is the best one i have seen ) , and the only reason it is not a masterpiece , in my opinion , is because it was too real , something metaphorical about it was lacking ; i went away from the film intellectually gratified , but did not feel the film opened up the emotional wounds of the locals whereas they would see anything more about the tragedy than the fact that their lives had been changed ; even if , some of the locals now question their motives to retain a lawyer , and that is now questioned in a way that it has never been questioned before . i have no problem with that aspect of the film , that was convincingly conveyed to me ; as was , the lawyer's motives , who comes across to us as not a good or an evil man , he is a man driven and ripped apart by guilt , even to the point of exhibiting bizarre behavior , as he searches to find a meaning for his life that he doesn't quite understand anymore , which is apparently more true than his belief that he is so committed to his work because he is trying to find justice for his clients ; so what we have , what remains for us to ponder , is the fact that nothing is as simple as the accident is ; everyone's life has been changed and nothing is the same anymore . but the question that still remains , is what has anyone learned from this , and that is left lingering because there is an emotional disconnect inbred in the story , when all is said and done , and we don't know for sure if anything was learned . nevertheless , atom egoyan has created a splendid artistic film . 
having lived through and somehow survived the cultural revolutions of the late 60s and early 70s american style , not fully aware of what the french upheaval was all about , except to notice that there was more of an identification over there between the working-class and intellectuals , and not the same usage of hallucinogenic drugs and anti-vietnam protests that was sweeping the american landscape . his pick-up line to her is , " i don't have time to have a drink with you but can i have your telephone number . " this " take me seriously " three and a half-hour film is surprisingly never dull , and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable participants in experimental living , that has its ups and downs as far as their compulsive libertine tendencies go . with all the so-called sexual freedom they have , it is discernible that there seems to be a lot of tension around them , making one wonder really if they are enjoying themselves more than their bourgeoisie counterparts are . all the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish 1970s rebellion is seen here , along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the similar mind-set , allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it should be for them , if what they are into is to be taken seriously as some kind of revoluntionary statement . this is not your typical hollywood romantic happy ending for a film , but one that is very fitting for this film . it is worth noting , that the director of this seminal work , jean eustache , killed himself at age 42 in 1981 , and that certainly some parts of this film were based on his real-life experiences . the acting is superb . the only thing that is impressive about his intellect , was that he is often seen carrying a book by proust under his arms as he goes to the cafe to read , which is bookmarked to the story about " the captive . " all the women are special in their roles , making us look at them bodily-wise as well as at their mind . i see very little differences between the 1973 sexual mores and the 1999 ones . the later year is when i saw this film on video for the first time . how this film plays out , depends on one's perspective about sex and relationships , and how important they are ; if , perhaps , they are the most important worldly concerns one has , even more important than money or career or philosophy , then this film should prove to not only be entertaining but mindful . if thought of , as otherwise , then the film could still prove to be a most revealing study of how women look at men , especially men who think they are real smoothies . it also should indicate that women often choose these smoothies over other men because they like to play games with men and feel comfortable being around such men . what the film accomplishes , is to not rely on its plot and on any particular message , but to allow things to happen as they normally would , relying on the compelling nature of the actors to garner our interest , and our natural curiousity about what makes us love one another until it reaches the surface of some common understanding . that this was successfully done , can be attested by me from my own experiences and how important sex was for me in forming a relationship during the 1970s , it also seemed to shape my attitudes in love and in the sense i had of the world . sex always seems to be revolutionary because it is never static , it is never quite done in the same way . this film shows no signs of its age , it is impressive enough for me to watch today as it was for me to live vicariously through it in my thoughts of the 1970s . i think that the filmmaker could do no wrong in this film , every gesture and endless chat seemed so terribly right . and if the film is not an optimistic one , then that is just the way the filmmaker saw the situation of the lovers . 
this is a noir film , one of the last one's shot that can truly emulate the spirit of the one's shot in the heyday of american noir , in the 40s and the 50s . melville wanted to make a french version of john huston's noir classic , the asphalt jungle ( 50 ) , as melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a gangster picture should look like , making it original while covering all the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs for 150 minutes . the intense action scenes amidst the changing weather from rain to snow , plus the wooded area and the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to paris , gives the film an air of resolute desperation , that is intriguing to watch , as each camera shot is done by the hands of a master , reaching far into his characters and their surroundings . bunuel has very effectively used surreal shots like this in some of his films . the heist of the place vendome is excuted in silence for the 30- odd minutes it takes to pull off the job . for mattei , there is no such thing as police without informers . the film's conclusion is as violent as it has to be , since the mood was set from the film's onset to end this way . by this time , we know all the character's rather well , as we see who turns on the other , and how hypertense a policeman's job is , with not that much sanity separating his job from the criminal's . this is a top notch noir film . it has done an outstanding job in uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation , that drive men so hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature . 
this is the first film made under the label of dogma , a scandinavian film group inspired by the danish director von trier , which insists that their new manifesto on how to make films , be adhered to by those who make films under their label . this dogma consists of improvised acting and hand-held camera work , among other dogmas the film must adhere to . it reminds me most of how godard filmed during his mao stage , but without the apparent overt political messages , as godard's films during the late 60s were anti-film films , replete with diatribes against the bourgeoisie , which seemed filled with the director's hubris and self-congratulation on his political stance , that he was right and others wrong in their beliefs , and his rather tiresome political cliches , that seemed to be more opportunistic than spontaneous , even though every attempt was to make the film appear as if they were spontaneous . to spasse , is a danish term , which refers to those who act like idiots even though they are not . these episodes of spassing give this film an odd look that is guaranteed to turn off a lot people and anger many , especially those who expect more conventional ways of looking at the problems young people face in society . the theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious , it is very difficult to feel much of anything for these middle-class drop-outs , as we first encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse , retardedly eating their food , under the direction of one of them ( susanne ) , who pretends to be their keeper , while one of them , stoffer , grabs on to a lady ( karen ) , sitting alone , and refuses to let go of her . they do another spassing in a rockwood furniture factory , which was more stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made about workers in a factory or about middle-class values , it was goofy in a way to watch them operate , as it seemed to be similar to the way that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to their older members who already went through the initiation process to join the group , but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a bunch of spoiled children . again , it was not funny , but yet , it was curiously interesting , in a prurient kind of way to see what the interaction was going to be between these two groups of outcasts . i think the point that von trier was trying to make , is that you really have to be an idiot to change the system , or think that you can change it , but that you can only be effective when you really confront who you are , reaching past the point of where authority rules who you are ; or else , you are stuck with the same cultural values you have always had and can't really change who you have been brought up as . being an idiot is the last act of despair . it is an act of courage . and it only matters when you can do it for real and not be using it to play a game . trier has made his point . he has won me over . this very unusual personal film , that is very difficult to warm up to , that mocks what is conventionally thought of as right , by doing what is unconscionable and politically incorrect , becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend , as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel , as they seem to be left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments ; and possibly , their emotional experiences that they can value . the film does not end with all loose ends tied up in a nice bow . and whether they reached their inner-self or not , something penetrated them , whether they are the better for this experience , is difficult to tell , but something significant to them did take place , just as we in the audience , whether we liked the film or not , something inside us was moved by what we saw taking place , causing us to react in a way we might not normally act when watching a film ; and , in my way of thinking , that is great filmmaking . 
satyajit ray's 28th and last film , he died in 1992 , is one that he shot in radiant color , and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one , it is much better than some of his recent films , which seemed to show his old-fashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like , to be in a decline with the modern theater goer's taste . this film moved me a great deal , as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization . the plot is rather plain . this makes sudhindra more suspicious of him than before , as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and well-travelled , but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor . the family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle . ray's choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers , especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe , is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn't forget our roots . the opulence and warm-hearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability . his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera , poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought , allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director's creative life , questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in , as he leaves us with this last eloquent film , one that has his signature firmly on it . 
the harshness and dreariness of the story is so pervasive , filled with so much pathos and heart wrenching evil , that it takes a great director such as rivette , to bring life and breath to the soul of the film , to keep out any superfluous material to this already startling story . rivette has made a memorable film , a grand and mesmorizing film , one that towers over other such benign hollywood films relating to this subject matter . her tragic plight is a powerful story , told with perfection of style and purpose , a story that is hard to put out of your mind . 
one of the all time fun pictures , with enough ingredients in it to please a wide variety of film fans . this was english actor claude rains' american movie debut and vehicle to future stardom , even though he is visible for probably less than 30 seconds of the film , and that comes only at the film's climax , who only got the role because boris karloff turned it down , afraid that the role wouldn't work for him because he wouldn't be seen : but rains' distinctive voice was all that was needed to bring credibility to the part he will always be remembered for . a film so perfectly and magically done , that is based on the h . g . wells novel , that is faithful to the book while adding its own flavor of campiness to the story , such as a wonderfully bizarre una o'connor , screaming her head off , as " the lion's head " inn's wife of the owner and hostess to the invisible man . a special film such as this one , brings unmitigated joy to those of the 20th century who like to sit in the dark and watch a world of illusions come across a screen , an activity that could have hardly been envisioned a couple of thousand years ago , and is looked upon , even today , with a strange reserve by those who don't take their movies that seriously , not understanding just how rewarding it is for those who find certain films so important to them , that it becomes an integral part of their life and they can see the same film over and over again and still derive great satisfaction in what they are seeing . as for me , i could have seen this film as many as twenty times already , starting when i was 12-years-old and first saw it on a tv program called " the million dollar movie , " and i still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it with each viewing . it is especially fun to watch it with youngsters who have never seen it before and are generally unfamiliar with watching a movie in b/w , just to watch the reaction you get from these youngsters , is enough of a charge , as they are perhaps surprised at the fun they are having in watching such a creaky story and its outdated hollywood version of an old established english country village . it is a film like this one , that can lure you into becoming a bona fide film buff . he is dressed so you can't see one feature of him , as he is wrapped in facial bandages and wearing a hat and an overcoat , rubber gloves and sun goggles . the gifted director james whale knew what to do with this story , as his serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is : there are certain things on earth man must not meddle in . dr . kemp is scared out-of-his wits , and the scene is filled with pathos , melodrama , and ironical wit , as griffin dresses in his unwilling guest's robe and pajama's and usual bandage disguise , and explains to him that his invisibilty is not perfect , after eating his food it could be seen for an hour afterwards , until it is fully digested , that in the cold air you could see his breath , in the rain he would look like a bubble , that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man , because he hasn't quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes . but how do you capture an invisible man ? the film comes to its splendid climax in the dreaded snow , with john fulton's ultra-modern , for its day , special effects , adding enormous visual support to the sci-fi story , having the invisible man's footprints remarkably appear in the snow . 
none of us know where we are going , could be the theme for this road movie , which is more intense and somber than most other movies of this ilk . their dreamlike odyssey , nevertheless , continuing , ever moving northward . the subtle answer , probably lies in what lies beyond the mist , there must be something to believe in , even if you can't see it . the camera work is stupendous , capturing in total the dreamlike quality of the film . we witness a wedding in the snow , a giant hand of creation being lifted out of the sea by a crane , and the innocent kids gazing out at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them . the mood is so harsh , even biblical in scope , that when it asks the question in its voice-over , " if i were to shout , who would hear me ? " this film is not a soapy hollywood production , it is a film that is meant to haunt us , to make us ask questions that we cannot easily answer . 
it is told in flashback , with a voice-over . but even he can't penetrate fedja's severe emotional problems . tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent story and exceptionally fine performances . this a dark film , and it is grimly shot , reflecting this dire mood . what is troubling about the film , is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored . in any case , it is better this way than the usual sentimental hollywood rags to riches treatment of such a story . this film is more in the spirit of reading someone like dickens , with strong oedipal emotions added to the bleakness of the story , as it is adapted from a novel by ferdinand bordewijk . 
this is a come to your own conclusion movie , that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution , but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story . whatever badii is searching for , this basically is still a philosophical movie , that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasn't been prescribed to them . it also indirectly asks the question , why would any one in good health and being sane , want to kill themselves . if i reply , help me out of the hole . if i don't , cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt . we don't really know the reason mr . badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life , except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job , that you don't know how someone else feels , you may be able to sympathize with them , but you could never understand their pain . but again , we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide , to the director it is obviously not that important , or else he would have provided us with more information . he probably thought like i did , at first , that badii was a pervert trying to pick him up . again , the contrast between the men' silence and the noise from their work is explored . but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide , and badii's cogent argument , that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying , just falls on deaf ears . mr . bagheri ( baghieri ) is a turk , who talks incessantly , giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch , with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on , and its close-ups on badii in his vehicle . then he asks badii , don't you want to taste the cherry ? don't you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset , and the stars and the moon ? as he offers logical reasons for staying alive , that are indisputable . kiarostami' point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state . films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories , is what the director is now telling us , since questions are more important to him , than anything else , they make us think harder about the things we do . my thought about the death of the linear film , as pronounced by the director , is that , if all you did was ask questions , as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself , you would still end up being the idiot questioner , if that is all you did , question everything , because somewhere along the line , if you are honest with yourself , you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe , and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format , and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made . why kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking , at least for this film , could have something to do with iran's repressive government and their long list of intolerances , that if he openly criticized them , it would probably result in no more kiarostami films for foreigners to adore . i'm a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films , as being the vade mecum of filmmaking , you just try to do what you can , if the film has a magic to it , it will work . i thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out , you don't know for sure if mr . badii committed suicide or not , but it also took the air out of the story's power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you , first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word . kiarostami was having fun with the audience , and if you weren't in the mood for his jokes , then you might have thought like i did , that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience i was having , with my imagination working on all cylinders , stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised ; and , by ending the film on that false note , and shooting it on video instead of film , it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in , as i originally thought it was . if kiarostami thought i needed a break at that point of the film , that i was forgetting that it was just a film i was seeing , then he miscalculated how i felt . but i still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously , a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life ( and at film ) , and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us . and , in any case , i know from my past experiences with great filmmakers , that sometimes i don't like what i see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing . so i'll leave open the option that my distaste for the film's ending will be subject to change , that is , if that is meant to be so . 
fed up with this , but resigned to the fact that there is nothing he could do about it , he volunteers for duty in the war zone of ww11 . the niece also yields a muffled " adieux " , that he might have heard , but does not respond to . losing , because silence means you can't voice what is in your heart and mind , and by remaining silent it can be interpreted as a tacit acceptance of defeat and an unwillingness to call out for what is right and wrong . means , when the chips are down , he is still a believer in the motto : my country , right or wrong . melville's film is stimulating and perplexing , yet it is simple in tone and in human spirit . it gave me chills to watch how natural it all seemed ; firstly , because the protaganists were so real and the situation was so menacing ; and , secondly , everything happens in such a matter of fact way , enhanced by being shot in the harsh and convincing tones of black-and-white , giving the film a certain disquiet with the sea in the background that is unsettling to behold . 
habit , supposedly a vampire movie , but , perhaps , it is more like a psychological thriller/love story . he looks out of it as he stumbles along , and as he looks around in disbelief , he sees the other celebrants in their costumes , and just goes stumbling on , not quite so sure if the scary creatures he is seeing are for real or induced from his inebriated state . you feel sam's agony of living in such a crowded city as n . y . , constantly hearing its pulsating city rhythms , experiencing its dark fears , and you are always aware of the noise and many distractions there are , especially when you need space to think . but one thing is certain , something bad is happening to him . what makes this vampire type of film different than the others , is that it is very personal , more about the psychological state of a guy who doesn't seem to be a psychotic , but is very confused about the new direction his life is taking him . most of the other films of this kind seem so unreal in regards to any kind of personal underpinnings that are frightening to them , that the fright in them appears to be from watching good filmmaking , not from something that can possibly crop up in their daily lives or invade their inner being . fessender has fully thought out the details of how a person can break down in front of us and not have any recourse in putting a stop to it , making the story as plausible and far-reaching as possible . there are a lot of things that happened involving relationships and inner perceptions , that you need time and peace of mind to think about , just as sam needed , that might never make sense . but that isn't the point . . . it is usually the things that don't make sense , that bother us the most . the film has a captivating style and playful mood to it , that keeps you involved in the intelligently told story , which is rare for this genre . 
it is distinguished by mamet's sharp dialogue and a cast that is just outstanding . the edwardian-aged story is chocked full of sensibility and rife with a tautness to it that keeps you fully tuned into its dramatics . the the film version of that event takes liberties with the real story . he turns out to be a better and more feeling lawyer than what catherine expected of him , which adds even more weight to the already intriguing story . its legal theme " let justice be done " really equates in this particular case to doing the right thing legally , which is acquitting the youngster . nigel hawthorne was simply brilliant in this role , conveying an urbane wit and a strong backbone for taking on the fight for a cause he believes in with all his heart . this is just a wonderful and an almost flawless film ( the only flaw : the likable family seemed so smug with their upper-class status ) . david mamet has done a masterful job in directing someone else's words to its fullest potential . on paper , the outline for this story and its denouement , do not suggest how great a work this film turned out to be . even its old-fashioned story is more modern than it first appears to be . don't miss this one . you might have to wait a long time before you find a film with both a family and a lawyer portrayed in such a genuine and likable mold . it was delightfully startling to watch the nuances every character performed , as they held their emotions in check by their keen intellect . yet what came through even more than their perseverance , was that underneath , in their bellies , there were all sorts of emotions taking place that we could see overtly in their character . 
a masterfully done noir piece . it is the kind of work that pre-dated the great jean-pierre melville's classic bob the gambler . characteristics have now become part of gangster film lore : that is , whenever gangsters are pictured in a romantic and old-fashioned manner . what distinguishes this film over most other noir films , is the grace it has and its ability to take its time and do a real character study of what max is like . and the director was just as interested in doing those scenes , as he was in filming the action ones . a great b/w film in every way possible . it has a hypnotic rhythm about it that takes you right into the gangster atmosphere it presents on screen ; there is not one wasted shot . 
this is a visually appealing hong kong ghost story film , that is highly stylized , told from the perspective of a courtesan , anita mui ( fleur ) . the film is evocative ; its strength lying mostly in its poetical presentation , as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and intelligence . the essence of the story does not depend on whether you believe in ghosts or not , though it would help if you would not be entirely reluctant to accept the possiblity that there could be a life-after-death . fleur , still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed , appears out of place in this modern capitalistic society , that has forgotten not only its ancient roots but its recent past . this film fascinated me on many levels , but mainly , it made me wonder about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved . it allows us the opportunity to ask ourselves , if we can really believe in spiritual things without being spiritual ? is there something worth dying for ? this is truly one of the best films to come out of hong kong in the modern era . even its ironical ending , is handled with great dignity and care ; and , even if , you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural tale , the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had , such as the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone . 
his menacing sneers are unforgetable , adding spice to a feature that makes grand use of every shot taken , and for its very limited budget of $75 , 000 , equals in style and eloquence the highest budgeted films of that era . kubrick has created a sinister noir film , employing dark angle shots and a hand held camera , which is used effectively in the street scenes where he probably didn't have official permission to be filming . it is a surprisingly well-made film , especially considering its low-budget constraints and the very independent way it was produced . it is one of my favorite noir films ; it had something about it that i enjoyed that goes beyond its taut story and authencity , it reminded me so much of how the 1950s were a time of alienation and failed dreams for youngsters who were trying to capitalize on the boom times after ww11 . 
all the sounds heard in the cell are the ones you would normally hear in a prison . there was no background music to take your mind off where you were , and by going through in precise real-time movements the daily prison grind , the constant personal searches and searches of the food parcels the men received , with the guard slicing up the rice puddings looking for files and such , the viewer gets the feeling what prison life is like for the men . there is something about claude that makes him stick out as an outsider , someone you don't feel right about . maybe its just that he comes off as too cunningly mannipulative in his contact with others to be thought of as a true friend . yet , he fits in so well with his new cellmates by not calling attention to himself and acting grateful for their quiet acceptance of him , that it is easy to see how he could be accepted by the men . they have accepted claude as one of them , as there was no reason not to , and feel that he has done his part so far in helping them dig a tunnel and has even shared with them the food parcels he has received . what he has created in this thriller is a marvel in simplicity and understated relationships , showing how uncertain it could be to trust an outsider with your life . that 
it seems obvious , but it is the most pivotal point of the film . the sounds heard from the factory or the music in the background , signal the extremes of pleasure and pain felt . the romantic maudlin gypsy music that opens the film , is followed by the oppressive factory sounds- a source of confinement and class differences . it is not a very optimistic ending for a film that touches on subjects that are not very comfortable areas for discussion . the film , in the social realism mode of many eastern european films , is lighter than most films of this ilk , but what it can't overcome is the total bleakness of its subject matter and how too many of its responses must be considered as clich ? s to a western audience . nevertheless , this is a powerful and well made film , and the performance of katalin berek , in a role where she defies social conventions but who must be someone that the audience can empathize with , is handled with a quiet dignity and aplomb . the entire ensemble cast is well suited to bring off this drama in a successful way , making one wonder , that even when the bureaucrats are seen as benevolent and people are finally sympathetic to a young girl's plight , life is still difficult . and for the middle-age kata , life is so unjust , that even her well intentioned gestures might not be enough to overcome the problematic nature of a country that seems to be stuck in its own malaise . 
life in this remote country village , called varkut , is oppressive , with nothing to do but work hard and eat a lot and watch bland tv programs . there is a coldness and distance about her , that speaks ill of hungarian society and its lack of warmth . the fierce b/w camera work captures the look of devastation on his face . the oppression is so great , that it is not even overtly mentioned , it is just taken for granted . but it is not pity that she needs , nor is it love that she can find or thinks she needs . this first feature-length directorial effort of m ? sz ? ros is staggering emotionally . its heartfelt dramatics and sparse dialogue , help make it a film of great quality and integrity . there is no soft pedaling of reality to spare the orphan's feelings . 
this documentary gives us a rapid-fire tour of the city and his lifestyle , and is both an encyclopedic look at the city and a slyly amusing look at the loquacious tour guide . in a place like manhattan where it is easy to get lost in its few million people , it is non-conformists' characters like speed that make things interesting and worthwhile . that central park was designed by the transcendentalist fredrick law olmstead , whose vision for the park was not to play baseball or jog or roller blade or a place in which to work up a sweat but to focus on nature in a peaceful meditation . civilization is a place that is splitting us part ; it encourages people to never say the truth . one feels nauseous but not sick in it . for him , it is these little things in life that one notices that give it its relevance . i loved this ecclectic tour ; it is shot in a clear video which is blown-up to 35mm , and looks magnificent in b & w , giving the film the proper atmospheric expression for its tour ; the documentary works so well because speed's for real , as is his flowery monologue and his genuine nyc nasal accent . if you were ever interested in a tour of nyc , this is a good one to catch , and you don't even have to visit the city . 
les cousins ( director/writer : claude chabrol ; screenwriter : paul g ? gauff ; cinematographer : henri deca ? ; cast : jean-claude brialy ( paul ) , gerard blain ( charles ) , juliette mayniel ( florence ) , claude-cerval ( clovis ) , 1959-fr . ) french new wave cinema at its best . we see this film through charles' naive eyes , who can't believe what he is seeing . he does enjoy wagner's music , as he uses that music and the superficial conversations he has with the other students , to convey a certain sophistication about life that he does not really have . a rather pathetic creature , whose goodness turns chabrol's stomach . no matter how impure a picture chabrol paints of paul and his dissolute lifestyle , paul has energy and is on the road to success . this all seems like logical advise , something we kind of expect a sympathetic parent to say to a hurt child . chabrol has carefully painted a picture , indicating that there is no help in sight for those who need it , whether from the pillars of society or from the rebels . skip the next paragraph if you don't want to know how the film ends and proceed to the last paragraph . chabrol's film would be interesting enough , just for its depiction of parisian student life , but when he moves into grounds of philosophical ethics and questions what love is to those who think they have fallen in love , his concepts become challenging intellectual engagements . the film questions the institutions and the people who have trust in them , and one's own morality . it is chabrol's rather cynical , but fair look at how parisian society operates and how young people suffer from the pangs of youth , sometimes even in a deadly manner . 
strange , bizarre , confusing , and psychedelic , all are apt descriptions for this easy to follow story but most difficult film to keep track of . that is mainly due to the elliptical editing , fast cuts , forward and backward flashbacks , and a montage of images with all kinds of implications behind them . it is a film , that of all studios , for warner bros . to come out with it , just doesn't make sense . this is not the type of independent artistic film they make over there . their reaction to seeing the finished product was predictably one of disbelief and disgust . nicolas roeg , at that point , disassociated himself from the film , but since his name was left on it , and cammell was an inexperienced 26-year-old director , roeg unfairly received the lion's share of the critical credit that was to come from some of the established critics who , true to form , didn't recognize what an innovative and masterful film it was until much later . an underground audience , well-aware of the peyote mushrooms and psychedelic flashes throughout the film , rushed to see it in a partylike 'hippie' atmosphere during the midnight hours it was shown , to packed audiences . warner bros . was clueless how to market the film , whether to make it a mick jagger 'rock' experience or as a gangster film . they danced , sang an ode to harry , and we saw that they can be just as notorious as america's gangsters . it seems as if , in a strange way , these two opposites , have similar impulses that give them their power to succeeed . i guess it is one head trip exchanged for another , each doing it the way they know best . chas looks and acts as anything but what society would take for normal . performance is also noted for its memorable music , as arranged by the rock genius , jack nietzche . warner bros . tried suing the director cammell after seeing how he completed the film , hoping not to release it , that's how bad the feelings were , for a film that lived on to become a cult favorite even though it never got its proper due with the straight critics and public . it was a film whose psychedelic flashes might seem a bit dated now , but all the best directors from kubrick to scorsese borrowed freely from it , as it changed the way many mainstream films were to be made after 1970 . the freshness and energy and montages of the film are unique , as it was able to mix the world of art with violence , something that seems to be a natural fit , as shown in these kaleidoscope images . it is a film that both gangsters and artists can sink their teeth into , even if the gangster might fail to recognize how he looks to others or to himself . a one of a kind film , deserving of much critical praise , as it is a most efficacious look at the subculture of the gangster and artist worlds and , simultaneously , a most enigmatic film to try and take in all its fanciful images and perversions and drug induced fantasies , though time has taken away some of its freshness , it still is a work of considerable power . 
it was different in style than other films at the time and was received very well by the critics . the film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences , though not pleasing all the critics . through all kinds of sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly received film , pasolini attempted to make his point about current italian society being like fascism . pasolini , the decadent anti-fascist , pro-communist , homosexual artist is a key figure in trying to come to grips with modern italy and its many passions , this documentary provides some useful fodder about him , whether you are a novice to him or have followed his career fully . one thing i can say for sure about pasolini , is that he is always interesting , even if he isn't always understood . this documentary gives one a good quick-look at him and should encourage those who are so inclined , to check-out his films or books , if they haven't done so before . 
what is noteworthy about the telling of the story , is how earnest and real their situation is , and how magnificently graceful the actors are , slowly revealing the sore points and tender sides of their troubled souls . the subplots that develop connect somehow with the main characters in an effortless way . it seems whatever you do in modern alaska , you have to hurt someone or something , whether intentionally or not . the ending of the film is problematic and inconclusive , though it seems apparent that they are doomed . many viewers will be disappointed that there is no payoff in the story . the film was well served by a capable cast ; and , even if , its story bit off a lot of ground to chew , a lot more than it was capable of fully digesting ( too many topics from environmental issues to dysfunctional families ) , it was still good storytelling . but it did try to get too clever with the plot allowing every angle of the character's problems to fit too nicely together-- there was too much of a parallel symbolism of the castaways relating to their three lives that was too neat for its own good . but this is topped by thought provoking storytelling , one that was visually stunning as well as accomplished with mature dialogue . the film didn't always work , as melodramatics seemed to take away from the tremendous drive the story had on its own merits as a straight romantic tale . but what kept it compelling was the human drama , that made me want to think that the trio had found something on their journey that they didn't realize that they had before . though the unresolved ending to the film might bother some viewers , that of being in a state of limbo is not the worst way in which to end a film , especially one where the storytelling itself is the aspect of the film that veers from guarded hope to fatalism , where each of the characters is seen on this deserted island as not being able to run away from their problems anymore . 
this emotionally moving film will look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working class girls , doing it in a way only the french can do it justice . isa is someone we think we know but really don't , as she is prone to be friendly and willing to make relationships , opening her dark saucer eyes wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go along with her warm personality and trim look of close-cropped black hair ; but , we are , also , distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her right eyebrow , which is never explained . there is a classic look of disgust on the face of isa , that seems to be saying , you are really sick , when she finally realizes that she has to move on from here . the performances of the two actresses was bewitching , as the two women deservedly shared best actress honors last year at cannes . the poignancy and merits of the film , are in depicting accurately the reality of the girls' lives . it is a film without one false note of sympathy or sentimentality in it . this is not the type of a girl-buddy movie as seen in some hollywood films of late , filled with glibness and glitter and canned experiences . here , what happens has the ring of truth to it and is powerful in the sense that its simple telling of the tale , without trying to be cute or pedantic , turns out to be profound . this debut film for the 42-year-old director , done with the austerity of a master , reminiscent of someone like a robert bresson , is a work of considerable merit . it is a film that not only depicted the shattering of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class , but it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the girls , looking at it in a poetic way . 
now this is an indie cult film , if ever there was one . they sell both bibles and guns , two contrasting products that fit very well into the mainstream of american society , makes for a most interesting commentary on the american landscape , as directed and written by the south african , daniel j . harris . this b/w , gritty film , is so well-paced and flies by so quickly , that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them and you don't want the film to end before you find out just what happens to them , as things begin to turn sour for them . this unique film , in the style of the maysles brother's the salesmen , packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and improvisational work . the theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology , in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen . but were're in the '90s all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are really dead already but they just don't know it . these very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on camera , as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat , in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre . one of the really powerful scenes , is the opening one when they are selling the collectors' edition bible set and a defender 500 pump-action shotgun in a trailer , it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to , " the american family deserves to be well-armed and well-read . " the director seems to imply , isn't that what america is about , anyway . they sold me on this film . these " stars " certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that is uniquely satifsying . this , suprisingly enough , is a not to be missed film , if you can ever locate it on cable . 
this is a dogma 95 styled film , where the danish filmmaker's group manifesto determines the rules for how the film is to be made . the idea is to give their films a fresh look and for them to provide the unexpected , and to catch on film the complete truth from its characters and their situations . this film was shot with a small video camera ( a sony pc7 ) that fits in the palm of your hand , then it is transferred to the prescribed dogma 35-millimeter format . i suppose it is fair to assume that one of the reasons that this manifesto was drawn up in 1995 by four danish filmmakers--christian levring , soren kragh-jacobsen , thomas vinterberg , and lars von trier-- was to give them publicity and challenge the film community to create innovative films . so far the only two films i saw from this group , von trier's the idiots & breaking the waves , have been challenging and impressive films . for those interested in what their dogma document actually states , i give you the following example : " 2 . the sound must never be produced apart from the image or vice versa . any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted . the film must be in color . special lighting is not acceptable . ( if there is too little light for exposure , the scene must be cut or a single lamp [must] be attached to the camera . ) " 6 . the film must not contain superficial action . is to say that the film takes place here and now . ) " 8 . genre movies are not acceptable . " 10 . the director must not be credited . " furthermore , i swear as a director to refrain from personal taste ! i am no longer an artist . i swear to refrain from creating a 'work , ' as i regard the instant as more important than the whole . my supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings . i swear to do so by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations . " rules like that rub me the wrong way . what i ask from a film , is for it to be imaginative and well-made , and i don't particularly care how the filmmaker accomplishes that . it would be impossible to go into the minute details of the film without immeasurably spoiling it for the viewer who hasn't seen the film . my pleasure in seeing it was that i was caught completely unaware of what was to occur and that shock kept me absorbed in the story , not quite knowing what to expect next . this might be the secret reason why the film worked so well , as i was made to feel like one of the guests in this theatrical film . the result of the film was exhilerating , dogma or not , it is a work that is scathing , penetrating layers of deceit and festering wounds that cannot be healed . but it was to no avail . to point out how the guests weren't quite sure of anything that was happening there , they are shown eating lobster , or salmon , or tomato soup , each one unsure of what they were served . the celebration is indeed a celebration not to be forgotten soon . it drains the emotions , somehow satisfies the intellect , and challenges the conventions of the usual fare of sophisticated family drama . vinterberg declares how the impact of helge's revelation affected everyone in the immediate family , and how that acted as a cleansing for the tribe , something that was essential for their psyches . at least , they now have some kind of a shot of pulling themselves together , even though the film does not show any of them changing internally . and how the film accomplished this , was through good storytelling , where one doesn't need any false constraints , something that is reminiscent of greek tragedy or shakespearean drama . 
his bust on the rock , he says , signifies that , " i was the rock and the rock was me . " the visionary dream is evocative of the music he created for the 1st movement of the third sympathy , as it is heard and interpreted by russell in a way that is highly complimentary to a composer whom he obviously admires , flawed personality , not withstanding . what gives the film force and a sense of inspired madness , and makes this a work the musical aficionado might question regarding its authenticity but the film buff might applaud for its richness of visuals , are a few very inventive scenes . the conversion scene becomes the most powerful and outlandish one in the film , as it is filmed as if were a silent movie changing to a talkie at the moment of the conversion . this scene comes on so strong as to drown out any other attempt by russell to have a more subdued film than he usually shoots for . he will then eat the non-kosher pig meat and drink a glass of milk with it , completing his conversion . always insecure and troubled , never happy , always irritable and petulant , a most unpleasant person , and a sexist ; but , a musical genius , is the impression of mahler that russell convincingly leaves us with . as mahler , in despite of his pettiness , bravely tells his wife , choose between me and max , but do not choose me because of duty , duty always destroys . but it is the music of mahler that is refreshingly digested , admittedly a music for acquired tastes , but a music that i most heartily appreciated , that gives the film its resonance . the film also plays like visconti's death in venice gone astray , where homo-erotic shots are coupled with coarse hetero-sexual shots . which result for russell , a director who has proven himself to be a music lover , who knows how to be flamboyant and controversial , into making a film that was very impressive . though the film , like mahler's music , is clearly not for everyone . 
the film critic , jonathan rosenbaum , has written a great review on the merits of jacques demy and his film , the umbrellas of cherbourg , going on to compare demy to the great japanese film director , yasujiro ozu . that both men achieved excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition through the eyes of normal lifestyles is , indeed , a curious oddity . umbrellas is made into an opera-like film by composer michel legrand . the actors sing their lines rather than just say them . the film itself is lushly colored in pastels , offering a very brilliant color-coordinated production . this story doesn't seem to be much on paper , but it is as poignant , as surely as it is ordinary . it is one that happens most of the time , rather than the reverse being true , of people marrying for love . and that is demy's point , that coincidences , luck , and good timing seem to matter even more than love . everything about this film was done to perfection . demy is one of the most underrated directors of french cinema . american audiences rarely get a chance to see his great body of films , and that is surely their loss . 
the conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over saving a life- there is no better feeling , he tells us in a voiceover , his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees all around him everyday . these images become a reminder of what hell might look like . that in a nutshell is the plot of the film , as this is a story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of those who choose to work under such trying conditions , and of the uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits , mary and frank . the audience is taken along for the grim ride and the entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very obsessively comedic ems men , who provide the necessary breaks in the story for everyone concerned , that is audience and driver alike . things are so insane that if you don't laugh , you can succumb to the intensity of the situation by just watching it . this is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark , with the noir style to the film provided by scorsese's frequent screenwriter , paul schrader ( taxi driver/raging bull/the last temptation of christ ) . this seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope . frank's way is through coffee , whiskey , vitamin shots , and living with ghosts-- and none of them work . this film is intense all right , and it drags on for much too long a look at the insane world it envisions , making its way through a grotesque looking city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house . the misery uncovered is catching , like certain diseases are . but is it worth it ? does the film have something salient to say , as scorsese seems more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf of the age of innocence and kundun , for instance ? is there entertainment value in this story ? that i really don't know , but i do know that it all seemed too real and that the acting was superb , one couldn't help but get entangled in the lives of the characters , and there was a rush of adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced . the nicolas cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a bewitching manner , as in his crazed ems role , he catches the futility and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with patricia arquette . the ambulance drivers more or less drove home the philosophical points of the film , as they acted out the insanity of the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being beaten down or hyper , with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes perversive attitude toward the job . the photography was mesmerizing , capturing the hostile living conditions of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night , and in the background , we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city shimmering in the night sky , seemingly changing colors . i'm glad that scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of the viewer , questions that take time to answer because they are complex , and could best be answered by one's experience with matters of life and death . and from what is mentioned in the story , we learn that there are spirits that pull you one way or the other , and sometimes the pull is not to want to live anymore . that should give one something to think about . scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one , but is one that is not suited for everyone's taste , since it takes getting used to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia ; but , the benefits are immense for those who stick with it . scorsese is undoubtedly one of the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to feel the pain of someone else , something that is very difficult to obtain in this medium . this is a very tough film to honestly say that you thoroughly enjoyed it , but what's more important than that , is how it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling it is in a meaningful way . this film , i expect , will be better thought of than most films of the '90s that attempt to focus in on the city landscape , including all those films that were so entertaining but in the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was . it is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece , taxi driver , and say that both films were about a dying city , about someone who works by driving either a taxi or ambulance at night , and about a similar hero who had a tortured soul that needed redemption , but the former film was so much better because it had more action in it , more energy , and did not compromise the story's pessimism . but i found this film to be more subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense , and even its most pressing fault , that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit through , should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer . this film can't help being anything but a disturbing film , one that questions the degree of contemporary insanity , and it is not necessarily a better or worse film than the other one , but it is one that has more psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more carefully . 
i was born , but . . . the shochiku kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies , something the great director , one of the world's most acclaimed , yasujiro ozu ( the tokyo story/late spring/floating weeds ) was keen on doing during this period of his film career , when he refused to make talkies until yielding in 1935 , but continued to make silent social comedies , somewhat in the style and equal to in quality to the charlie chaplin and buster keaton films , though ozu's films were seen through the eyes of children rather than taken from the adult's point of view . they were ably co-scripted by the master of the nonsense film , akira fushimi . in i was born , but . . . , a film with lots of sight-gags , made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family , mr . yoshii ( tatsuo saito ) . this splendid example of a salaryman's film , is the first great film of the master's , with many others to follow . there is a comic sandal fight among the boys , which brings out the film's visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters . in fact , ozu's camera angles for adults when talking to children , are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults are talking down to the children , always in a position of superiority . ozu draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children naturally socialize , and states that the adults power is vindictively social , derived from one's station in life and how much money one has . the home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for yoshii and the children , as yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen as an obviously inferior man than his boss . yoshii , himself , is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much , but he is secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make everybody laugh . taro's only comment is , your father is really funny . ozu' other purpose of showing the home film , being always the gagman , it also gives him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie , such as by using the same tracking shots and camera height angles . the wry salaryman responds , " if i didn't , i wouldn't get paid and you wouldn't eat . " the boys illusion is that all power can be won through one's talents . but in the business world , the boss doesn't have to possess those character traits , he is the boss because that is the way society is structured , and it pays to submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to fend for yourself . the " but " in the film's title comes into place , as it indicates that everyone is born equal , " but " that changes soon enough . there is always something to disturb the stability assumed from the outset . it is now clear that yoshii grovels because he can't do anything else about it . and like many parents in america , he only wishes his children have a better life than he does , which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light . the plot of the film is encompassed within a short five-day period , and it parallels in a didactic way the social structure of the children and the grownups , and how in each group adjustments have to be made in order to survive , with the majority of the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up . the adult world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys' limited horizons . 
he has come up with a possible masterpiece , arguably his best film , that overcomes a questionable b-movie plot , to achieve an elegant , memorable , and poetic story . he leaves for work at the sound of the eerie throbbing of the jungle drums , which is only announcing that the sugar syrup is ready to be poured . it is interesting to note , how this 1940s film had a tolerant and respectful attitude to blacks , and even allowed them to be critical of upper-class whites without being rebuffed for it . but the treatment doesn't work . one of the all time greatest scenes in horror movie lore takes place , as betsy takes the sleepwalking jessica through the thick jungle of the sugar cane fields while the howling wind and rustling branches and sound of a conch is being blown to bring to the ceremony the faithful . the ritual voodoo ceremony is done in a deliberate and quietly dignified manner , with the result being hypnotic . the obscure motives of the mother and the nurse , and to who was at fault in paul's marriage , and what role wesley plays in all this , is never cleared up completely by the film but that only makes the story more intriguing . jessica's personality is seen differently through the eyes of others , but since she was a zombie for the whole film , we have no idea what her role was in this indelicate affair . the seemingly innocent betsy , seems clever enough to have thought of a solution to this problem that could benefit her . the natives want the case of the zombie settled , they feel there is enough sadness on the island , as is . the power of the script , is in the telling of a tale about local superstition built around the moral dilemma of what is the christian concept of right and wrong , and by creating an unforgettable and haunting atmosphere that blows away the less than sterling acting by the male leads and the unlikeliehood of the story being totally believable . tourneau's direction for this low-budget film was marvelous , and it was spectacularly shot by roy hunt in its chiaroscuro imagery , bringing to light a film that is both incredible and magical . 
" mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images . " georges auric , cocteau's lifelong musical collaborator , said that he wanted to compose the score for an animated cartoon . cocteau was asked to provide a scenario . this became " the blood of a poet , " still one of the most widely viewed of all cocteau's screenworks . there has never been a film quite like le sang d'un poete . cocteau used all his energy and his diverse talents in a medium that was new to him , as this film represented an aesthetic milestone in his career . was it nonsense or serious filmmaking ? in my opinion , a little of both , though the result of the film is a serious work . this 60 minute film is ostensibly , a work on the nature of creating art . special weightless effects were obtained by camera trickery to show the little girl flying up to the ceiling and the poet moving painfully along the corridor wall . once cocteau discovered that he could turn shooting disasters into excellent footage , he was off on a career of making films that carried his trait of creating trick shots : the miraculous mirror and mercury scene in orphee , the live arms holding the candelabra from the walls of la belle et la bete , and the accelerated time sequences of flowers opening in le testament d'orphee are only a few examples of the trick shots he used in his later films . for cocteau , poetry is a coat-of-arms . the film ends with the message : mortal tedium of immortality . in the last frame , an industrial chimney shown in the beginning of the film , finally collapses and all material things are crushed . so much of this film is mysterious and vague , undoubtedly autobiographical in content and motif : cocteau himself always denied the presence of hidden symbolism in the film , but word got about that it had anti-christian undercurrents . this was really not so , according to cocteau , but the false rumor did its damage . it greatly distressed the noailles . the life-line of the movie is its imagery , which can be interpreted many different ways , emphasizing cocteau's view that art disclaimed the world of ordinary appearances and projected vision to be a symbolic representation that must be continually changing , because if it doesn't it will be dead like classicism is and it will cease to exist . the director was afraid that the avant-garde movement would die one day like all other artistic movements have . because of its unusual theme and style and unpredictability , this is a film that deserves the high accolades many film critics have bestowed upon it . it resolutely shows how the filmmaker communicates into the spirit world , and he does so without being pretentious . 
first-time film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on , cooked by charles kaufman's original screenplay , that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate , such as a psychological , personal and sexual identity study , allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being . it is a playful and provocative look at determining one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within , featuring an actual celebrity , the performer , john malkovich , who is playing himself , as the mind who is being entered . if someone could market via virtual reality how to actually do that , it might cost as much as $200 for a 15 minute sightseeing trip down that path , the charge established in the film for such a trip , while for the movie viewer it is only for the nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique experience . the running gag being , that the overhead and the rent are also low here . since the glimpse into malkovich's head is more or less fictional , it's delightfully funny to find craig turning up inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading the wall street journal in his park avenue apartment . the film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy . but even as it was petering out , it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity , to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing , and leave off with an ending that is unnerving . what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well , is that the actors get the joke and run with it , even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize . and if anything more can be said about john malkovich than that he is a grand actor , it is that he comes across as a good person , someone with a good sense of humor and someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is supposedly at his own expense . this is the kind of strange film that one would expect to be released as an art-house indie , yet here it is playing as a mainstream big production . 
this is a must see film for historical reasons or if you are a film buff . its cinematic influence is tremendous on so many great directors that range from fritz lang to billy wilder . so they improvised and created an eerie style that brought the artistic german expressionist movement into the film . this unique film influenced the genres of horror , children's fairy tales , and crime films from the '20s - '50s , and by using the same style of lighting and dark mood as these mystery stories , they became known as noir films after ww11 . this seemingly simple murder plot , of a crazed medieval-type of svengali , who orders his somnambulist to do his killings , is much more complex than that , and it is one of the reasons that this film has meant so much to so many different people at different time periods . by its odd style , accented mannerisms , all the actors wearing grotesque makeup , and exhibiting a stagy acting method , it becomes a very unsettling film . through its amazing sets , the film best expresses the insanity of its theme , and the story enhances this theme , as the authorities are shown to be either incompetent or uncaring , and madness proves to be the staple of the film . this is the story that the narrator is telling . but it is all so confusing , that the possibility exists the narrator is just making this whole thing up . this asylum director must have liked what he read about the evil magician , with the idea that imitation is the best form of flattery , as this book is found in his desk . but the story doesn't end on this note . they did not want a film with the message that authority is not to be trusted and should be subject to severe questioning . this story is now viewed from the point of view of a " framing device , " as it appears that all that previously happened could be derived from the narrator's deranged imagination . the last chilling words coming from dr . caligari , who is now seen as a more benevolent soul , go loosely like this : boy , have i got a cure for you . caligari , however limited in scope , is still a powerhouse of a horror film , a significant breakthrough in style and in expression : a poetical vision . even in its altered story form , the film is still spellbinding and weird , as its ambiguity makes for many interpretations . either francis or caligari could be the lunatic . this note of ambiguity , instead of spoiling the story , only adds further intrigue . this tale of lunacy smolders in our psyches and allows us to look at this story's skewed world without knowing all the answers . we are left wondering if there could ever be justice in this world , as corrupt powers always seem to have a way of covering up their misdeeds . 
this is a grim morality tale that can't help putting you in someone else's shoes , wondering what you would do if you were in the same situation . instead , he does the most savage thing he could possibly do , he gets igor , who is becoming very squeamish at this point , to help him bury amidou in concrete , even if he is aware that amidou is still barely alive . how cruel can people be to others ! . . . but something has happened to the kid . la promesse has the harsh reality to it that a documentary might have , and considering that the sibling film directors are acclaimed documentary directors for over two decades , it is easy to see that even though this story is fictionalized it , neverthess , is filmed in the manner of the very real experiences that the filmmakers have noted going on in modern europe . the three main characters of the story are cast perfectly . the film could have been done from the father's point of view instead of the son's ; and , even more interestingly , from assita's ( the widow ) way of seeing things , and the film would have still had a tremendous impact . but there is an unmistakable presence she has , that clearly shows the nobility of her character , especially when contrasted with all those around her whose minds are so blemished . roger is one of the slimiest guys you could ever meet , someone who tries to pretend he is good but it so obviously not , that it is written all over him what he really is . there is room for us to see in him what makes him act the way he does , that he is not that far removed from the consciousness' of the ordinary man in the street , except for his utter lack of decorum and any sort of social conscience . from his point of view , we could see that he is only looking out for number one , thinking , that if he doesn't , who else will . but they can't see anything wrong . this powerful tale is unflinchingly honest and moving . it casts a dark shadow over a civilized country's technological prowess in the world , and questions its humanity and moral perspectives . it does so in a most tangible way , in a way that should be a disturbing reminder of how complex the problem of immigration is , in a film that is piercingly on target as a challenge for the european countrys to keep their " promise " to the immigrants and to see how corrupt their system is and how it doesn't really stop these powerless people from being exploited . 
the often filmed story of joan of arc , but a story that is seldom successfully filmed , is attempted again by jacques rivette ( up/down/fragile ( 95 ) /la belle noiseuse ( 91 ) /la religieuse ( 65 ) /celine et julie vont en bateau ( 74 ) ) , and the results for this epic study of joan are more than pleasing but less than scintillating . rivette was born in rouen , france , in 1928 and it is interesting to note , that was the year when dreyer's magnificent silent version of joan first appeared onscreen , which was made as a spiritual testament to joan's moral courage . he was a critic at cahiers du cinema and the much praised movie director is now considered to be one of the more noted unorthodox directors around , who will be forever associated with the french new wave . sumptuously filmed in brilliant color , it captures best the wonderful shades of france's fall and wintery colors . scenes shift as dates change and are so indicated onscreen . we see in rivette's joan , that it is her sobering historical story that counts the most and the price joan will pay for that , is that when compared with dreyer's joan , we don't have the same intense passion for her as we do for dreyer's more spiritual and intense joan . in this film , it is the king's coldness and the church's intrigue that strikes us , while joan and the soldiers she fights with , are given a warm treatment , as if they were the heroes in a hollywood war movie . the floundering country is in such a bad state , that it is about to be completely taken over by the british . my sign from god , will be proven on the battlefield of orleans . by may of 1431 , she is told by the bishop at rouen to either abjure or burn at the cross . she says , " god has pity on me , i damned myself to save my life . . . but this film seems to be the most accurate version of all the joan films , thus far , as rivette followed the trial transcripts and whatever history of her battles were recorded by eyewitnesses , but it failed to move me in an intimate way as much as the dreyer version did , which made more of a personal statement and an artistic response to those in power who try to stifle the voice of an individual's expression , while rivette uses the visual epic scope of history to make his point , that the call for freedom is not necessarily separate from politics . her performance was more than acceptable , but it was not memorable or moving . rivette's version is good to see as a companion piece to dreyer , as they both have things in their films that the other never attempted , and though rivette's version is intriguing and colorful and politically savvy , it is not a masterpiece . it is just missing that magical ingredient in it , the something that dreyer found when he went for the abstractions , the something that history couldn't tell . 
the public loved these films , until the " talkie " pictures came into being and this film was forgotten until rediscovered in the 1950s by henri langlois and in the 1960s by directors such as alain resnais and jacques rivette . musidora was a former music hall star , whose raven hair and seductive looks suited her villainous black-garbed heroine role in contrast to the sugary sweet blond american heroines at the time , who starred in popular serials such as the perils of pauline and the exploits of elaine . the combination of lyrical , odd scenes of naturalism and the melodrama of a crime-fiction story , as the film is full of disappearances and disguises , sudden deaths and uncanny resurrections , hidden trapdoors and secret tunnels , bus chases and rooftop escapes- which gave the film its power , its sense of dread ( perfectly matching the public's mood at the time of world war1 ) . and it was that , coupled with their almost anarchistic view of society ( the vampires steal only from the rich ) , and their often contemptuous disregard of logic ( the result of tight shooting schedules ) , that made the films so popular . les vampires was treasured by surrealists like andre breton and louis aragon , which gave it weight in intellectual circles , also . les vampires is one of france's great classic contributions to the world of cinema ; and fortunately , this once lost film has now been restored and is available on video . 
celine and julie go boating ( celine et julie vont en bateau ) ( director/writer : jacques rivette ; screenwriters : eduardo de gregorio/juliet berto/bulle ogier/dominique labourier/marie-france pisier ; cinematographers : michel cenet/jacques renard ; cast : juliet berto ( celine ) , dominque labourier ( julie ) , bulle ogier ( camille ) , barbet schroeder ( olivier ) , marie-france pisier ( sophie ) , 1974-fr . ) it is an incomprehensible , enjoyable , uninhibited slapstick romp . as insignificant as the title of the film is to the story- i am at least sure that celine and julie are seen at one moment towards the end of the film going boating ( at least , i think i saw them ) . but there are unusual complications to this already complicated story ; and , in the subplot , there are two actresses playing the same part , berto/ogier and dominque/piser . what results is an hallucinatory fable : that is funny , scary , idiosyncratic , original , lesbian-centered , derivative of cartoons and musicals , and truly indescribable . it is a true cinephile's delight , and a challenge to the old linear way of looking at films . it is a film that should be seen more than once , since it requires proper mood and spirit to enter its delightful summertime montmartre locale and the visions of its meditations , and it takes some getting used to , since this is a different type of cinema from the usual american fare . this is a special movie that some might detest or feel put upon on first viewing it , but is for others an exhilarating work , an outstanding example of a non-commercial film , allowed to take on the personalities of the stars without worry about it being a formula story or needing a glib ending . it is deserving of its wonderful reputation among cinephiles . as my mother used to say , when she gave me something to eat as a child that i wasn't familiar with and i made a face , try it , who knows , you might like it . 
it was one of the early yiddish talkies to date and one of the most prestigious . schwartz was celebrated as being the 'olivier of the yiddish stage . 'he is one of the world's greatest actors ( he was tevye in fiddler on the roof ) but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be . this comedy/romance that turns dramatic , should give you a good idea of how great an actor he is . though he is not a religious man , he respects the traditions , as the film makes many biblical allusions in telling its story . 
those two great legends in the horror field went on from here to make a total of seven films together , but none as co-stars with equal parts , or in a feature that was as good as this one was . in most of their films together , lugosi , who was the poorer actor of the two because of his limited english , was always cast in the lesser role . the script for this film was altered so much , that the only thing remaining from poe's story , is the brief appearance of the black cat in the film . though the film does evoke the mood of a poe story and the feelings of kafka . the crowley characterization was by boris karloff , who played the role of hjalmar poelzig . he will mention that he is a writer of mystery books , and he quickly adds , books that are unimportant , and that if he had any sense he would be honeymooning in niagara falls . he then offers an excuse for vitus's action , saying he has a common phobia , but in an extreme form . that the result is an intense horror of cats . there's not much action , but it is very eerie to watch this strange scene . the film is very strong on atmosphere , shot in the style of german expressionism . it is not as strong on plot development or of the story making complete sense . but as a film shot originally as a programmer for universal , this horror film turns out to be a work of true art , and is still one of the best horror films ever made . it is a film of subtle and subversive gestures and one that sets a disquieting mood . this is ulmer's masterpiece , his defining work . 
his rambling story is a near-masterpiece of vision and great perception of what was taking place , as it let go of plot development and storyline , and instead captured the moods , atmosphere , and insights making up the changing landscape in america's unprecedented time of political unrest and social change , as the mostly white middle-class student joined with the black militants demanding that the system change . the explosions take place in slow-motion and pink floyd's " careful with that axe , eugene " plays as the products of commercialization go floating by . antonioni wanted to make a film that visually shows that it is a change of attitude inside your head that changes the system and not violence . that if you can't change yourself and are still caught in the consumerism trap , you can't change the way society is driven , you will only change the surface of things . reality is inside your head . it is not by killing off your enemies that you accomplish your aims , but by getting your act together so that you are not part of the problem . it is up to you to make the world a better place to live . she promptly takes off , as antonioni is sending a message that if you think you can escape from the world and your responsibilities by retreating from it , you are mistaken , you only make matters worst . the film originally garnered bad reviews in general and ended up being a commercial failure , subjecting the director to some unfairly harsh criticism . but it was probably the most perceptive film made about that turbulent time , and it is not outdated like most of the critically praised films of that particular genre are when viewed today . 
he feels compelled to always have a gun , as it makes him feel important . but in this expressionist-like opening scene , it is shown that bart will have little chance of overcoming his obsession . it now becomes a road movie of a crime spree , or a love-on-the run film . bart comments : " two people dead , just so we can live without working ! " the swamp was used because this low-budget film couldn't afford the money to pay extras and the swamp scene would require only a limited cast . as film noir , this hard-boiled story is much superior to the more popular and more critically acclaimed " bonnie and clyde , " which covered the same territory story-wise : amour fou- the running away together by lovers . this fast-action film , with its typically notorious femme fatale depicted , is subversive to the nth degree . he complimented films of this kind by endearingly calling them , " perceptive trash . " whatever weakness the story had as it waivered between art and entertainment , and even if it was acted by not the most accomplished of actors , yet there was a raw innocence about it creating a special kind of appeal to those who could feel its lively pulse beating to their resentment of the establishment . 
nicholas ray's exotic pyschological and neurotic western , in which he covers his usual outsider theme but in a western that doesn't feel like any other . it feels as if freud wrote the script and everyone's sexual motivations were constantly being psychoanalyzed . it was almost as if the film was a parody of a western , humorously examining what a man and a woman are supposed to be like , while playing games with the western conventions . it also could be thought of as a political allegory , a critical reaction to the witchhunt of mccarthyism taking place at the time , of the senator's self-righteous attacks on those he didn't like and for going after others for reasons of guilt by association . nicholas ray was so enamored with mercedes' manic performance , he called it straight " sulphuric acid . " the film opens in stunningly beautiful trucolor , as johnny guitar is crossing the mountainous terrain and the mesas , and the pastel colors of that scenery comes across as particularly striking . the mannerisms of all concerned are weird , to say the least , especially for a western film . no western has ever had female leads with twisted personalities such as in this one and a psychopathic drifter as its sort of reluctant hero . i think i saw that heroic bit on one of those roy rogers movies , so this is a western after all ! there was a lot in this western to digest , and most of it is in its relentless use of sexual symbolism . 
a precious and unnerving thriller , one that never fails to offer some kind of hitchcockian surprise , as the film is unpredictable throughout . but harry is troubled by this and refuses to release the tapes to anyone but the director . this somber thriller is a beauty , projecting a maddening character study , and infiltrating a secretive and cold world , where the protagonist , a private wire-tapper , has lost his sense of direction , knowing that one's privacy can so easily be exposed by expert technicians like himself and be used for any purpose . the acting was magnificent on all parts , the story was grippingly told , and its denouement , is the equal of the best thrillers ever made . a unique film , whose great sound track by walter murch , is essential to the plot , as the technology in the film was the key element in setting-up the very eerie atmosphere and bleakness associated with a technology used so despairingly . the film is even more relevant today than it was back in the 1970s , as the world has become even more so of a place where it is possible for technology to invade the privacy of any citizen . 
" laura " is an elegant but campy b&w " who-dun-what , " noted for its witty dialogue and exquisite romantic atmosphere among the upper-class society types being confronted by a detective from the proletarian-class . this didn't stop the constant bickering between otto and darryl , as the studio head wanted john hodiak for the dana andrews part , and he did not want newcomer clifton webb in the villain role , nor did he want first-time cinematographer joseph la shelle to do the photography for the film . it is a good thing otto won his argument , because his choices all did great jobs , and webb , lashell , and preminger all received oscar nominations , with only the cinematographer winning . it should also be noted that jay dratler , samuel hoffenstein , and betty reinhardt , were nominated for best screenplay . the french reviewers in the 1940s were the first to call this kind of dark thriller , a noir film . it is one of six or so films they named , such as " the maltese falcon . " he is a ruggedly handsome , muscular type , who speaks in the common-man's vulgar tongue as compared with the snobbish effete lingo of waldo . the sexual nature of the three suspects seems perverse , as homosexual aspects to their character furtively emerges in their mannerisms . the film brought out the following observable things about the suspects : ann seems more masculine than feminine , shelby appears to have stereotypical " gay " tendencies , while waldo is a flaming bitch ; as they all exhibit , in the very least , a certain amount of sexual ambiguity . what it all boils down to , is melodramatic , leading up to a maddening conclusion , as the prissy he-men , who both seem to be oddly sexually attracted to laura , become the two most likely suspects . what made this a special film , a classic , was how stylishly smart it was and the magnificent performances of both andrews and webb . the former's performance being done with a subtle wink of an eye , was stolid , steadfast , and no-nonsense , complementing the caustic performance of webb , who is viewed as someone ailing from a pygmalion complex . also adding to the film's aesthetics , was preminger's impassive direction , allowing the audience to become voyeurs , with his direction offering no resistance for them seeing whatever they have to about these characters ; and , finally , there is the arresting cinematography of la shelle , creating a moody atmosphere and a mise-en-sc ? ne that is provocatively twisted . it is hard to find fault with this very satisfying seductive thriller . the film even had a great theme song , written by david raksin especially for the film , which takes the same name as the title . 
but the fireworks between the lovers is only beginning , as both feel betrayed and unsure of what to do . the magic in the film is in the chemical reaction between garfield and lana , their performances are sizzling . the reason the film is so provocative , is that it hits below the belt , where the lovers were most vulnerable . he has gone too far afield to evoke any sympathy for his plight . 
his films are noted for not being linear narratives and for examining people who are in a state of moral decay . the film opens with a quote from pushkin , " even if you kill me , there will be no trace of me , only the devil will be going round and round in circles . " the content of his film usually overrides its style , at times he seems to care very little how his film looks . this film is a minor transformation for him , there is some effort to make the film seem more stylish . this all indications point to these arguments taking place over a long period of time . conversations are so tense , there seems to be no hope for them . all these characters are emotionally distraught , suffering from jangled nerves and loneliness . this is a tough film to watch , but if you want to see something introspective , something that has a rawness to it that is uncompromising , then this existential-like film fits the bill . it generates an uncomfortable and uncompromising tension that is very perceptive about the human condition . above all , its message is , you must love someone , which is easier said , than done . the filmmaker subtly asks the question , of all his characters , what is it that you believe in ? 
cohen's song will pop up continuously throughout , giving the film an arty flavor to it , as it also adds to the explanation of the film's despondent theme of a small capitalist against the big capitalist . " mccabe & mrs . miller " is an antiwestern western , whose themes of love , gambling , alienation , suffering , death , and capitalism , are as haunting as the cinematography of vilmos zsigmond' beautifully colorful pacific northwest territory is , and as haunting as leonard cohen's ballad is , and as haunting as the moody atmosphere of this winter wonderland of desolation is . the drunken mccabe succeeds by luck : by being at the right spot , at the right time , and not by any skills he might possess . altman's film is strikingly lyrical and perfect in mood ; it is a dreamlike film that is hauntingly memorable , that is magical in scope and sadly touches mccabe's yearnings to find love and a place to put down roots . the result is a poetical western without heroes , that is pathetically witty , where mccabe and mrs . miller's wishful dreams are seen as either foolish romantic notions or drug induced inspirations , ones that never had a chance of coming true . 
an historical fantasy film that took eight years to make . this low-budget independent effort ( it had a whopping budget of about $20 , 000 ) , initiated from an original idea by kevin brownlow . the events are make believe ; the b/w film resembles an orwellian nightmare . this is where this fantasy film begins . it looks as if it is a semidocumentary , with scenes padded for dramatic effect and narrative . the power in the film is from the sheer force of the clash of ideas and the expressions coming forth from the nonprofessional actors . the film allows you the luxury to see things for yourself instead of being spoon-fed what to believe . the result was that seven minutes of the film were cut until recently , when brownlow regained control of the film and milestone released it for the first time in its full version . this scene of euthanasia was done in a most humane manner , by injecting them with poison , it was one of the most powerful and stunning scenes to behold . the filmmakers used mainly original rather than merely authentic costumes and props , and they refrained from using any archival footage , which would have been easy to obtain . they drew most of their sense of history from the 1940s by watching newsreels , but in the film they only used voice-overs from professionals who donated their services and used montages and close-ups to get the 1944 look they wanted . you can say whatever you want about their methods , but when you look at the results you feel the intensity and madness of the drama , it has a curious starkness about it that is very compelling . it had the mark of a true artist's stamp on it , even its amateur production values do not weigh heavily against it . even the ending of the film , as it comes to no particular conclusion , it just ends by allowing this remarkable work to be viewed for what it suggested , shows a confidence that the film accomplished what it set out to do . it certainly took the smugness out of anyone thinking that fascism couldn't surface in a country like england . it showed the final liberation by the americans , as an ironically gruesome scene , where collaborators were rounded up and executed . a call for pacifism , is the clearest message that could be heard from between the lines when all is said and done . 
winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery , as it depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent . the narrative is taken from the pamphlet writings of gerrard winstanley , a gentle , christian radical . he sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s . the film is based on the book by david caute , " comrade jacob , " but has been thoroughly reworked by co-directors brownlow and mollo . his unique filming style , his penchant for austerity , his demand for authenticity , his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no event sticks out from the others , and his inspired devotion toward looking at the past , perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past tragedies , gives this film an air of adventure . lacking the necessary dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public , this film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty . despite being filmed without the benefit of professional actors , the only professional being jerome willis who played general fairfax , this film has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in the face of the actors . it is brownlow's way of filming such misery , a way that records the diggers' sufferings as if it were the official record of what happened , and probably could pass for what is official . this sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power . it's a lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence . this film acts as a vehicle to understand what the diggers believed and how they lived , and how they justly thought that the earth was made common property for everyone . that everyone born on earth shall be fed by it and that all are equals in the creation . his performance was beautiful . there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time . it showed breeds of pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th century . the film's cost is about the same as a james bond film's title scene would cost . the film's cinematographer , ernest vincze , like almost everyone in the film , including the directors , worked for nothing . it doesn't pretend to have the answers , but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to live and work together , is one worth asking . the message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many , including the marxists , the bourgeoisie , the film critics looking for a more recognizable kind of film to evaluate , and the common man , bored by what he doesn't want to know . but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic . the scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor , making the action seem more pertinent . their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind . try comparing winstanley to other period films of the commercial variety , and it is hard not to see how much more real and meaningful this film is . if nothing else , at least , it is a hard film to forget . for the poetic dream of winstanley , for an equitable and more reasonable world , one that is not forged by malice and greed : that is a vision the world is still waiting to see actually happen . this film is available on video by milestone . 
charlton heston as will penny , gives , arguably , his best performance ever , in this magnificent western on an aging cowboy , a loner , an illiterate , faced with the prospects of a dim future . written and directed by tom gries , who achieved critical but not commercial success with this demanding psychological character study on the hardships of a cowboy's lonely life , one of the most underrated westerns ever made . he never made a film again of the same quality . all the rawhiders give over-the-top performances , with pleasence's one being as maniacal as it gets . the chemistry between heston and hackett was magical . the script captures the nuances and local flavor of the cowboy on the trail in an authentic and moving manner . the direction was superb ; the lucid cinematography added to the splendor of the story . an elegant western , exemplified by truly subtle performances by heston and hackett . 
this film was made in mainland china and is one of the great and courageous films of the 1990s . it has been banned in china for its political content , and the director has not had another film of his released overseas . tietou tries to make sense out of what happens to his ordinary family , but he just can't seem to fully comprehend why so much misfortune occurred . " the blue kite " is the most acrimonious indictment in a film of chairman mao's regime , that i can recall . the picture best demonstrates how the politics and history of the revolutionary times affect the lives of real people . this provocative film is not a flattering look at the myopic political situation in modern china . it tells of simple truths , emphasizing family life , while it is brilliantly crafted in a most moving way . times are difficult , there is not enough food , but everyone seems happy and there is a sense of strong family ties and a strong comradeship among neighbors . there is also an air of innocence and fun that seems to be contagious . the point of the story is that the bonds between mother and child remain strong , no matter what . this film accurately captured the mentality of those who go along with such acts , those who are brainwashed into always thinking they are right and ignoring all the harm they do to people that might have different opinions than they do , people who just want to live peacefully and have decent lives . it is surprising that this film got out of the repressive clutches of china . it clearly showed the horrors of the human drama inflicted on its subjects , the tremendous portrayal of motherhood by lu liping , and the oppression emanating from the chinese dictatorship . this lyrical film offers an eye-opening experience about recent events there , and probably the only people it can't penetrate , are the maoist international movement , a group that is in self-denial about how tyrannical china is . 
a wonderful film . mike leigh's valentine to the theater . this 160-minute musical epic ( just right in length--the film was never dull for a second ) , moves at its own very satisfying speed , enhanced by the magnificent musical arrangements of carl davis and replete with many hilarious episodes ( it's a very funny film ) . it also has an opulent cinematography by dick pope , the eye-pleasing stagework of gary yershon , the just right costumes by lindy hemming and the impeccable performances by all concerned , with special kudos to jim broadbent as the constantly sulking and cranky librettist william schwenk gilbert . leigh makes this into a story about what happens backstage : capturing the arduous process of creating a gilbert and sullivan show from scratch , accurately depicting the petulance of the actors , the reality of the business side of show business , those dreaded rehearsals , and all the delicate balancing of egos that come into play , as the director pushes for the performances he wants . it couldn't be more real or more tempered with total affection for what the actor and writer must go through to get what they want out of their work . it is as good a story about the backstage happenings as any in films , and is so much superior than shakespeare in love , which basically did the same thing last year and was rewarded with an oscar . it was amazingly well done to watch his facial and bodily transformation from one of a grouch to unmitigated joy in an instant , as his love for his work is written all over him . as " the mikado " goes into rehearsal , gilbert forcefully directs the play and the actors are just as brilliantly daunting whether rehearsing or cavorting backstage , or performing for an audience . one of leigh's pet themes over the years , is for actors to do improvisations . his meaty part couldn't be played to greater perfection , in a performance that is memorable , making it difficult not to think of broadbent whenever the name gilbert will now be mentioned . topsy-turvy captured best director and best film honors in the new york film critic awards . but with the success of the mikado , gilbert tells his wife that he can't handle such happiness , " there's something inherently disappointing about success . " musicals don't get any better than this offbeat one . he is so sure of what he is doing , the film is so well researched for authenticity without having to put the film in a period straight jacket , that it retains a refreshingly modern attitude despite being properly set in victorian times . the beauty of the film , making it so much more than the typical musical , is that the director caught the environment of victorian society , allowing it to add a socio-historical perspective to the backstage dramatics of the theater people and to the travails of the g & s partnership . this historical perspective was depicted , by flashing the newspaper headline of the death of general gordon and his men in the khartoum massacre on the screen and then the film zeroes in on some actors stuffing themselves on oysters , basking in the bourgeois society the empire has made possible for them and so many others in england . but the director's main point wasn't political as it usually is , he merely wishes to show what a colossal effort it is to put on a stage show and that g & s individually would have undoubtedly found great success alone , but it is only with their collaboration that their success is so magnificent , and that we should be grateful for what their partnership gave the world . i'm also grateful that leigh made this film . i felt just wonderful leaving the theater . i knew that i saw something special . 
a . i . this is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s . the opening scene is a memorable one . he begins by saying : " i would like to say a few words about weddings . i've just been through one . " even the caterer ( leo g . carroll ) , proves to be an unpleasant problem to deal with , as stanley wryly says , " an experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in fifteen minutes . " 
errol morris knows what he is after in this film and mines it out of his resourceful subject . this hubris is a trait he shares with many idealogues , to a certain degree . he is a tiny , mousy , and loquacious man , someone who compulsively can't stop talking about what he does for a living , which lends a dismal sense of perverse comedy for half the film until his unchecked demeanor began to grate on me and he became overbearing . it is not hard to think of him as a twerp , whose expertise in executions seems to be real enough but who otherwise is a strangely enigmatic man , someone whom it is not possible to really penetrate . he is someone who disturbingly can't think straight about things that most any child would have little trouble with , such as knowing the difference between what is right and wrong . in other words , like the nazis who gave germany more technical efficiency , he is the perfect imitation of them in spirit . yet , he is someone who isn't even aware that he might be a nazi , he has so desensitized himself of any sense of moral consciousness and responsibility for his actions . i think that he had to know when he joined forces with a neo-nazi group what he was doing and what kind of risky political stand he was taking , and that he would be considered part of that hate group of holocaust deniers , that there could be no way he could continue to maintain that he is not an anti-semite and be believed . certainly not by holocaust survivors , who are used in the film to tell what they think of him . to think otherwise , that he is just an innocent fool , would be to deny what is the obvious . earl morris makes documentaries about as good as anyone ever has , tackling subjects that others would shy away from ( this being his seventh feature- some others are-gates of heaven/fast , cheap & out of control/the thin blue line ) . his works are not mere biographies or hollywood driven achievement celluloids , but poetics of the cinema that sing to our inner sense of being , that make us think about the life of the person on film in a way that we most likely wouldn't have thought about them if we had not seen what morris saw and presented us with . this film is no exception and like the director's other works , it's a visual testament to the human spirit , warts and all . in an odd way , because of his individualism , he is even appealing , which makes this a very scary film--as ultimately , it is about how evil flourishes if it goes unanswered . leuchter is disarming when he is talking with love about the equipment he put together and how well it works , and how compassionate he is for those being executed , wishing only for them to have a good execution . for anyone in their right mind to believe such garbage , is beyond comprehension . for anyone to have done what leuchter did and not be an anti-semite himself is , in my opinion , very unlikely . leuchter's tests were diluted too much by going into the depths of the walls , where it would be impossible to find traces of the gas . leuchter became not just a witness at the trial for neo-nazis , which is bad enough , but he also went on the lecture circuit for these holocaust denial revisionist groups , enjoying the neo-nazi groups' affection and applause . all he could say as a rejoinder to his accusers , is that the execution by cyanide is too impractical a method of genocide : " why didn't the nazis just shoot them all ? " this documentary offers one of the most pertinent looks at two highly charged emotional subjects : capital punishment and the holocaust , which makes for a devastating comparison . what's also worth noting , is how acceptable and rational leuchter is until the moment the neo-nazis take hold of him . that should give one some food for thought about the american penal system and how it is used to punish offenders . a highly recommended film . 
ghost dog is the seventh feature film , of arguably america's most innovative and underrated director , jim jarmusch . i consider it a shame that one of america's best directors had to get european backers for this film and still receives a better reception abroad than he does in his own country . she then says in a low voice , " you can have it . i'm finished with it . " when louie flinches , he says it is better than if we murder you . there is comedy here in the absurdity of the situation even though no one cracks a joke . but , one of the points of the story , is that things that happen don't necessarily make sense , they just happen . reading books is readily accepted by both parties as something that is cool . the assumption is that they both have soul and can talk the black man's rap . the film is much influenced by jean-pierre melville's stylized 1967 gangster masterpiece le samurai , which also quotes an ancient japanese ideology that influenced its hero , though in that film , it is from the book of bushido , which is a fictional work . ghost dog remains for the most part a parody of other movie characters . the film is slow-paced due to the stoppage to read from the excerpts from the hagakure texts by whitaker . it is a movie that is mostly invigorated by forest whitaker's stunning performance of a man who is an icon , who lives by myth alone , whose most memorable statement , is that " the end is important in all things . " the most glaring error ghost dog makes , is in his strictly literal interpretation of what he is supposed to do as a samurai warrior . that would have been the true way of a samurai warrior , whose lessons are meant for battle and seem to be easily misinterpreted by someone living so cut off from human contact and without the benefit of a teacher . jarmusch has in all his films displayed an interest of seeing how another culture looks at the american culture , having already shown how hungarians , native americans , and japanese react to seeing america . it now seems to be the turn of the black man , as this film is basically about the forest whitaker character making peace with who he is , and showing that to be an american , it takes more than one culture to influence you , whether it's the mafia men absorbed by cartoons or rap music or poetry , or the director himself , influenced to be a so-called " hip " white negro . for jarmusch , america is an exotic place where different cultures uniquely flourish in the most unexpected spots . the shining points of the film come from the moving cinematography of robby muller , the minimalist mise-en-sc ? ne , the splendid expressive performance by forest whitaker , the underlying humor , and the freshness of jarmusch's approach to filmmaking , proving that he is someone willing to take chances . there are critics who constantly rave about less cutting-edge films more than do about ones that are not afraid to mess with set-concepts . for this film , they offer mostly faint and lefthanded praises . as for me , i'll take my chances with heaping praise on a jarmusch near-miss like this one , over so many other forgettable praiseworthy hits that are so limited in scope . jarmusch's first language is poetry and it is my belief that this film is as close to a lyrical masterpiece as a film can be without being one . its weakest point being a lack of character development for the mafia figures , as the mafia characters were more cartoonish than real , they seemed to be created to fit a certain standard mold rather than to be developed out of their own personalities . but that flaw , was also what drove the film comically , therefore making that weakness more palatable and understandable . this film is similar in mood to his other ambitious work , which was a masterpiece , dead man , and it is one that makes so many fine points to justify its wide range of themes . it is foolish to try and tightly categorize it , except to say that even though it is not exactly a mainstream film , neither is it primarily an art-house film . it just might be one of those intriguing films that requires an acquired taste and once acquired , leaves no doubt about how good it is , no matter that there are a few things in it that might be considered tasteless . 
it is visually the best of such films made , a classic study in heroism and in military planning , that stays with the men in battle as they fight for survival and doesn't go off into the politics of why they are there . the aim will be to hold the outside perimeter at all times and reinforce any side that is being attacked . the battle scenes were memorable , the acting was first-class , the director correctly offers no explanation for the why of the battle as the action itself seems to explain the absurdity of their situation . the professional soldiers say , " we fight because we are here , there is no one else who will fight for us . " the film offers no explanation about the racial nature of the conflict , as it is played mostly as a story of a courage on both sides . the film does not display a racist attitude . burton announces that there have been 1 , 344 such medal given out overall . chad and bromhead worked well together despite their class differences , with chad showing a natural ability to think fast and act without indecision . there is a certain fascination about this movie that makes it a moving experience , especially in watching the zulus perform under endfield's direction . zulu is presented in such a tough-minded and matter-of-fact way , that it is hard to argue against the way it was filmed . it was also an interesting bit of casting by the co-producers endfield and baker , of having the cockney caine play a stuffy upper class englishman . but it worked ; caine was just splendid , it is still one of his finest hours in film . 
this riveting noir thriller was made on the heels of the kefauver crime hearings in the u . s . senate . bannion has a judgmental thing about women , looking at them as either saints or whores . but , bannion is skeptical , as he is left without any doctor's report as proof . for bannion , this is seen as a hopeful sign that people can change . they don't get much better in noir films than this stark and gritty classic . it has the auteur signature of lang written all over it , with outstanding performances from a cast that puts their stamp of reality on the film . its nihilistic message about humanity is scarring , glenn ford's pyrrhic victory in the end and his restoration to his old job , seems to have a cynical feel to it , meaning that violence and corruption go together in city politics like ham and eggs . this is a dangerous film , its message is not an easy one to receive . 
mckellar goes for the smaller private moments rather than a grand philosophical argument about the meaning of life or a catastrophic special effect ending . the focus of the film isn't on any sort of biblical apocalypse , nor is it on the outside revellers and looters , or on those who gather in the city square to make it a new year's eve celebration , but it is on those who think out what they want to do and plan to spend a thoughtful evening preparing for the end . the wheeler family uses the catastrophe as an excuse to make this a christmas celebration , believing that even if it isn't christmas that day was the most memorable one for the family and the day of the year they most fondly remember . the sardonic humor and clever performances by sandra oh , don mckellar and callum keith rennie , leave a lasting impression . sandra and don make their experiences seem so vitally human , while callum remains the eternal materialist . the premise is a question that many people have asked themselves , as i recall parties where the game played was to say how you would like to die , and the responses were always so varied and revealing . 
this indie film is filled with many gratifying small touches , as it takes its time developing and forces one to tune into the way victor sees things . this is the kind of human interest story that hollywood slicks up and can't make in quite the same realistic way that a good indie film can be made , that takes its time in bringing out a number of small truths , so that by the time the story winds down , a big climactic ending is not needed , all the pain and pathos has already been drawn out of it . in contrast to victor's gentle nature , he's always high-strung . the film works so well because the performers are outstanding and the writer/director has come through with a very touching debut effort . there is something precious about this film , whether in shelley winters warm performance as a giving but possessive mother , or from pruitt taylor vince's priceless performance of someone who hardly speaks and is a doting son , longing for love and friendship , but who still hasn't matured , or from liv tyler's refreshing role as the one who breeds life into the dead feelings of both mother and son , giving them some hope for the future . the musical score arranged by thurston moore helped set the quiet mood needed for the story to gently unfold . everything about this original film was honest and natural . all the characters know what loneliness is , even if they mask it better than the mama's boy does , and because of that , it is easy to relate to their very demanding problems of loneliness and how it has eaten away at them -- making some fat , others blind to what they are , or bitter . 
one of the really haunting films of the 1990s . a film about a life hitting a wall and taking the starch out of a young person's sense of being . it is so painful to see what existence means and doesn't mean to a teenage girl , that it is hard to look at this film without thinking of it as a documentary . its underlying theme is about the impossibility of leading a moral life and being moral , that no matter what one does , existence supercedes everything else . she played the role with conviction and gave a truly unforgettable performance . the dardenne brothers have made an urgent film about today's job market that hits home on its universal pathos and how those on the bottom are taken advantage of by unfair employment practices . it's a theme that forces you to look at the young girl in an introspective way and at her poverty as something that is real and not something that can be dismissed by other distractions in the story . rosetta's life is more reflective of how ordinary americans manage to scrape by and actually exist , than in all the ludicrous themes of the escape films most americans flock to see . this film is rich in all the things about life that hollywood chooses to gloss over in its need to get a blockbuster film . its star does not exude beauty and is not faced with episodic adventures . they have created a masterfully perfect visceral film , that is unflinching in its realism and unsentimental in its study of her . what makes this film so uncompromising and ironical , is that we are not asked to like or even accept rosetta , we are only allowed to understand that she does what she has to in order to exist . isn't that the way life really is , anyway ? i found a job , you got a job . i got a friend , you got a friend . i will not fall in a rut , you will not fall in a rut . i will lead a normal life , you will lead a normal life . in many ways , her story is ours , there are no national borders to separate us from such agony . there is nothing more important for most people in the world than in securing a job , and there are very few films that take the pains to show that getting a job is so serious a matter . i think that the film critics who downplayed this film into the minor category because of its lack of action and tedium , missed a chance to see a film that had much more to offer than the usual type of escapist entertainment fare . this film has the distinction of being troublingly unique , it is devoid of any philosophy , it is even different from bresson's " mouchette , " a masterful film it is most closely akin to . bresson had too many religious and catholic agendas in his film to achieve the starkness this film does . this is a film made for purists of the cinema , those who don't want to see another disposable film , but who wish to see a film that is unmistakably direct , a film that they can see themselves in if they are not too calloused and frightened of life to look at the dark side . it is society's mistake if they make someone like rosetta invisible , and it is our mistake as filmgoers and critics if we ignore films just because they bring up unpleasant subjects and we don't feel entertained by them . to be so prosaic in our viewing habits as that , we would be on the same slippery footing as rosetta , striving for the same kind of ridiculous normalcy she was after . 
a marvelously compelling documentary , even if it seems rigged when it isn't , as everything fits so smoothly together due to the efficiency of the filmmakers . the boxing and real-life experiences are equally covered in a spellbinding fashion , as the n . y . u . it is the same storefront gym that produced riddick bowe and where mike tyson worked out , so success has already touched some who climbed out of this slum . the lanky noel gives it his best shot , but just doesn't have the skills to advance in the golden gloves . tyrene runs into some hardluck and her story is really the pivotal one in the film . life is tough in bed-stuy and no matter what some supposedly well-meaning liberals say about the violent nature of the sport , for some , it is a way out of their predicament . it takes courage to go in the ring and try to prove yourself , it also takes some kind of instinctual intelligence to be a successful fighter , and that might be the best skill these three aspiring boxers have going for them . boxing might be their best chance of succeeding in life and i see no reason why they shouldn't be given that opportunity . this was a wonderfully intense documentary . the full impact of what i saw only hit home with a wallop when i thought about the film afterwards . the filmmakers were unobtrusive and totally professional , as technically it doesn't get much better than this . 
" the thing " was long suspected of being directed by howard hawks--much later on this was confirmed by the actors . this is one of the better science-fiction cheapie films , one that became a cult classic . it is a wonderfully banal film about a flying saucer landing on the north pole and a superior alien , who looks like frankenstein , being thawed out . hawks wastes no time with any liberal messages about why this creature came here , instead the film has a jovial air force crew snappily banter at each other , a sparring romantic relationship develop between the womanizing captain and the scientist's independent-minded secretary cut through the fierceness of the monster story , and for quirkiness , we see plants as monsters crying for more blood to spawn more monsters . the cast is perfect , their non-chalant attitude gives the film its raucous mood and allows the warlike atmosphere between beast and man to be a battle of both wits and brawn . but the air force is only interested in the safety of everyone concerned and see no redeeming value in communicating with the alien . nikki snaps back , " you boil it . " then , as an ironic twist , the monster cuts off the heat in the building . but carrington has gone crazy , clammoring " i want to understand it , " and has shut off the generator . the film closes with the excited scottie breaking the story to the world , screaming into the microphone : " i bring a warning--to every one of you listening to the sound of my voice . tell the world , tell this to everyone wherever they are : watch the skies , watch everywhere , keep looking--watch the skies ! this is a fast-paced and enjoyable b-film , giving us a feel for the cold war paranoia taking hold of the country at the time . it is about how anyone different is viewed as an enemy , and how there is a sense of isolation for intellectuals in the country . 
dariush mehrjui is one of iran's finest modern filmmakers , his speciality is making films about relationships among the upper-middle-class illuminati , and especially love stories about women . this drama is a very powerful , poignant and mesmerizing love story , about the pressures of dealing with moslem traditions and of a woman's own sense of being . why this marriage should turn ice cold , when everything is so blissful , is amazing to watch as it unfolds . this is a truly heartbreaking tale without contrivances , that examines a woman's psyche , looking carefully at her wants and her expectations . reza is never forceful enough in his statements telling her that it doesn't matter that she can't have children , as leila has nagging doubts about whether he really means it or is just saying it . the couple have all the creature comforts of modern life and act like modern people do , and are seen playfully watching dr . zhivago on tv together , but tradition is also very strong . this is a very compelling and subtle film , on one hand it shows the current conflict in iran between modernity and islamic tradition , but on the other hand , this is a penetrating film about the universal problem of love , as seen through the psyche of a woman who is stripped of her self-esteem , and even though she is beautiful and has a considerate husband , she is still not sure of what her role is in society . this is a very sensitive tale ; it is film that was convincing in every possible situation it presented ; it is the work of a great director . 
this is the director akira kurosawa's international breakthrough film , garnering many awards , including hollywood's 1952 best foreign language film oscar and the golden lion award , at the 1951 venice film festival . rashomon became incorporated into the everyday language , and japanese films became a regular part of the western world's film culture mainly because of this film . the strength of the film lies in its attempt to show how the search for the truth is laden with traps , as all four narrators of the horrid event depicted are supposedly telling the truth according to what they believe they saw but their truths still turn out to be veiled in mystery . in the intellectual scheme of this puzzler , kurosawa determines that the truth cannot be found because 'the truth is relative . ' the film is blemished only by kurosawa's backtracking at the conclusion , coming up with an unconvincing and hokey humanistic ending to counter his more potent argument that everyone lies for selfish reasons . what makes the film special besides its interesting philosophical theme , is the high-powered performances , especially the one by toshiro mifune as the manic bandit tajomaru , and in the frenetic movements of the camera ( whether slow or fast paced ) and the way it captured the intensity of the film , giving it its sense of urgency . this was a unique filming device used by kurosawa , of zooming in on the character when telling his or her version , as each had a different rhythm that the camera underscored by revealing the particular mood of the storyteller . the common man is not surprised that mankind is selfish , as he takes a cynical view of humanity , anyway , listening to the story as if it's just a typical murder one . the woman's version is quite different , as each narrator tells a version that makes them look good . there was no duel . she asks the court , what should a poor , defenseless woman like me do ? he says he almost forgave the bandit for acting honorable at that point . all three participants are shown to have poor character . the truth is subjective and can't be believed in its entirety because of each narrator's ego . this contrived ending is supposed to show that there are still those who will unselfishly reach out to help others . the film has not aged that well , though it seems to still be a powerful picture but , in my opinion , not the masterpiece it was once thought of . i think the same reevaluation will take place of kurosawa's long and distinguished career and he will be downgraded from being crowned as a great director to a very good one . he seems to suffer in most of his films from too much sentimentality and contrivances , though his strong filming techniques and very muscular camera work , as exhibited in this film , will remain his ultimate trademark . 
" beach red " undoubtedly had a positive influence on two recent world war 11 films that had the same theme , terrence malick's " the thin red line ( 98 ) " and steven spielberg's " saving private ryan ( 98 ) , " only cornel wilde's film is the more powerful and impactful one , dissecting the fighting marine in one of the most alluring allegories made about the futility of war . spielberg's overall work pales in authencity besides it , even the landing on the beach scene , which wilde depicted in just as gory a way , holds its own with " saving private ryan . " while malick's film suffered from too many pretentious moments of philosophizing and did not have the same authentic personal touches that wilde's film had . the film will work its way through all the action scenes by highlighting four soldiers , who generally are reflective of all the marine's views . it uses the clich ? s about these men to push its story further , going past the clich ? s , to eventually show the bigger picture and ask the bigger question of why there is war . the men are heard thinking aloud , in much the same way malick used this device in his film but here it seems more natural and was done some 30 years before he did it . what also helps give this film a very real look , is that the men come across as soldiers trying to act rather than actors trying to be soldiers . this brilliant , subtle film , connects war with the everyday attitudes of mankind , as it penetrates the soul of those in combat , seemingly , better than most films of this genre . it's a film whose voiceovers of how the men think hit deeply on the emotions of its subjects , also its use of flashbacks are superbly utilized , and its brutal coverage of the war itself has the force to show what combat must have felt like . this neglected war film is as rough and tumble as any sam fuller film , as poignant a reflection of the racial divides in the military as any ww11 film made before the 1960s , and it leaves a lasting impression that is both haunting and expansive . when cornel wilde says , " that the trouble with killing , is that after awhile we forget why we are doing it , " we see how the film has the resourcefulness to deal with both its pacifist message and with the certain primitive rawness it portrays , that gives it that uncertain edge all influential picturesneed . 
this is one terrific musical , outdated or not . the song and dance numbers are playful , the story is meaningful , the performances are marvelously refreshing , and the plush settings are very colorful . it is a film that borrows freely from the hollywood musical , but adds its own very french touch of romantic spice , allowing the film to spring forth with a burst of vibrancy . the film's musical score is an easy one to remember by michel legrand , and its story is told almost exclusively by song , with lyrics by demy . johann sebastian bach is also brought into the musical picture in a most revered way . the spirited choreography caught my fancy , even though it probably was not as perfect as jerome robbins would do , but it was a good enough imitation that was attempted by norman maen . it is a film where music is everywhere , when a fair comes to town , the pedestrians suddenly break out in a dance number , giving the film an odd but potent touch of reality , as the film does not aim for plausibility . everything about this film was hopping , there were no dead spots . as in his other romantic films , demy points out that love depends more on chance and good timing than anything else . her gruesome murder is made into a jolly song , continuing with the upbeat mood of this surreal film . everything seems to work , no matter how awkward , there was just so much energy and good chemistry , that mistakes were made unimportant . i simply loved it for its vitality , realizing that if i saw it in the 1960s , i might not have been so taken with its lack of political perception . it was a film that had bad timing for its release date , it was the wrong time to pay homage to hollywood musical films , such films were already passe and revolution was in the air and in the arts , and this film was just an anamoly . 
an unusual film from the always interesting director takeshi kitano ( fireworks/violent cop/sonatine ) , taking an entirely different direction than the violent gangster films he is renown for . the dialogue is almost completely muted , as there are long stretches of golden silences and no translators for the deaf are used or needed to make things understood . the couple communicates by their expressions , rarely using sign language . it is a most compelling and unique film , one that is emotionally satisfying , on a level of a bresson film for its sparseness and the emotional connections it makes with the viewers . they go to a spot where a regular crowd of surfers hang-out , and while shigeru is learning , the others laugh at his inexperience and lack of proper equipment , he doesn't even possess a wetsuit . there are some splendid scenes where we view him at a surfing contest , the chikura surf classics . there is little need for dialogue to convey its story , for what is clearly shown is how human nature can be understood by deaf people , that one does not need language to express how people cling to groups and glorify their own exclusiveness . the film always has a light strain of humor running through it , yet what remains memorable , is how beautiful the summer scenery is and how effectively simple the story is , molded together in a very discriminating way while presenting a very touching love story . this is a cinema fans true delight , a purely visual film without the need for high-tech artifices . 
cameron crowe ( say anything . . . /singles/jerry the film is not raucous rock , but offers a sweet view of the music world , pointing out why its popularity is high among adolescents , while also exploring its business side . the casting was perfecto , not that the acting was necessarily arresting , but it was that everyone seemed natural for their roles and gave expression and a sense of truth to what was happening . all you can do is write about them honestly . that will be the mantra of the film and also its hardest attack on the industry , but it is carried out to perfection by this great cast and directed with a sure-hand for drawing out the comedy and whatever goodness there is in the artists and the groupies who follow them . but the film will go on to show that everyone connected with the music is delusional , the musicians are not as serious about their music as they pretend to be and the " band aids " are only fooling themself if they think they're not groupies , as they stroke their unsatisfied egos by basking in the glory of someone else . he , thusly , fails to heed lester's advise . what i thoroughly enjoyed about the film was the casual way it let its characters act and be themselves , even if it was rehashing characters and rock music scenes played out in many such films , but here it seemed to be very easy to absorb and take in without dissecting that 1970s hippie scene . instead , it let the story make whatever sense it could without going overboard . i doubt very much if the film caught the full-flavor of that period , but it did catch what it had to , and all the characters avoided falling into being stereotypes . billy crudup is a very fine actor and he is able to be different things to different people in this film without making it seem as if he were disingenuous . the film might not have been flawless , with some mild lapses in character development ( groupies were thinly sketched ) and the story resolvement was not convincing ( a contrived bumpy plane landing scene , where the band fearing death confess what they really think of each other ) , but the overall zeal of the film overtakes those gaffs and allows the film to be much better than being merely a nostalgia film , and much more entertaining than any serious rock film i have seen . cameron crowe seems to have found a niche in making teen films that are much better than teen films . he seems to have an ageless sympathy for teenagers and for those who teens idolize , not categorizing them as either good or bad people . also , this film is suitable for both parents and kids , r rating or not , which is not an easy chore to accomplish when making a hip film . but moms should like it , as the frances mcdormand characterization was more eccentric and mannered than one-dimensional , and after all , the kid listened to her and didn't take any drugs ( at least it wasn't shown in the story ) . 
it has a cast of attractive and famous stars , and was a box-office hit in europe , but is a film that has received very little notice in america . it is a return to form for the 83-year-old master , who in his last film ever , is able still to put his recognizable signature of post-modern style on the work ( now considered old-fashioned ) , even if it is hard to imagine how he directed while under such a handicap . there is a quiet and easy pace that allows the stately film to be properly absorbed as a meditational exercise comparing the similarities of the spiritual , erotic and aesthetic world , and could be viewed by many as an end of an era work that is both enthralling and bound to rub some the wrong way for its politically incorrect moments . but to just ignore this film and give it no venue to be shown , is a slap in the face of one of the world's greatest directors . i thankfully got a chance to see it on the sundance cable channel . wim wenders is around to connect the dots in the stories , direct the opening airplane prologue and the epilogue ( his filming style is noticeably flat when compared to antonioni's ) . the film has the appearance of pretentiousness because the stories all appear slight and the voiceover by malkovich doesn't seem to add much flavor to the stories . yet it isn't pretentious . there is an intensity about the way the master's camera captures the stories that give his silence and his sometimes unsatisfyingly sophomoric dialogue an opening for ideas to be filtered through , making the sheer beauty of the mise en scene something not less than breathtaking . john malkovich plays antonioni , a director traveling around italy and france looking for characters and ideas for a film . explaining what he is about as a director , malkovich lays it on thick by stating " i only discovered reality when i began to photograph it . " he further muses , " the only thing i do in my films is try to discover what's behind the photographs . " the two make love , but casually depart as they can't seem to make a more demanding connection . again , the beauty in the story , as in all the tales , is in the photography , showing this bare materialistic apartment , surrounded by the icy steel colored interior , filled only with a black leather lounge chair and a piece of art valued only as a decoration piece , visually telling you more about the couple than words could ever . on the surface , the story appears like a conventional bedroom farce . there is also a light comic scene , which seems to be thrown in as a joke at the director's expense , as the late marcello mastroianni is an artist on a country hillside copying a cezanne masterpiece and jeanne moreau is laughingly mocking him for not trying to do his own thing . in none of the tales , is there an easy explanation for what attracts them or prevents them from being lovers . it is in the enigma of what it is the lover's want or why they are compelled to want certain things , that makes this a fascinating film , one of the great ones , even when there is the occasional uncomfortable voyeuristic feeling it might leave the viewer with , as the power of antonioni's work rattles under the skin and he doesn't help by giving you any answers , such as if it is easier to go after what one desires no matter or for one's desire to remain unfulfilled and for one to make the best of it . this a work of great care and imagination , an erotic film that moves modern cinema closer to the edges of pornography than it would care to admit , and it leaves room for many ways to look at love , which might be the baton he is passing on to the younger directors . 
this low-budget western appealed to both stars because it was really a homage to their careers , as they would be playing aging gunmen , an extension to the many different characters they played in their long film life--where their combined film total must be over a few hundred . because of their terrific acting skills and peckinpah's stylish direction , this film turned out to be a classic , one of the better westerns made . this is one of peckinpah's more appealing films , it is visually stunning , fully capturing the gorgeous mountain landscapes and comparing it with the more gaudy view in the modernized town . it is also peckinpah's warmest portrait he paints of a woman's sufferings in any of his films , as one can only feel pity for the anguish the sexually repressed hartley has by living in such a backward frontier settlement . 
roman polanski sets up a tense atmosphere for this macabre tale , where every black-and-white shot is subjectively motivated by the deranged character played with quiet brilliance by catherine deneuve , until the final shot becomes one of objective reality . the only thing to be said in favor of these ghastly murders are that these men were not nice and were extremely pushy , wanting to use her and not caring that she didn't even show the slightest interest in them . this is an austere and timeless grand guignol work , one with little dialogue . this is the first of roman polansky's english language film's and his second feature ( the first was " knife in the water " -1962 ) , and this one might be his best work . it is eerie , unsettling and intelligently created , showing deneuve's emotional breakdown in an impactful way , by showing it in psychological terms of deterioration and not as a creation of special effects . this is a scary film , one of the best in the world of horror films . 
it has become a cult favorite , and i thought it was far superior to the other two films . there are no over-the-top performances and no unnecessary gore shown , yet it is a nightmarish voyeristic look at a criminal hunter going after his prey by looking inside himself for answers . what director-writer michael mann does well , is build suspense through the serious characterizations . the actors speak in muted tones , while in the background , the pulsating soundtrack of bands such as red 7 , shriekback , and iron butterfly , set the chilling mood . dante spinotti's photography is beautifully effective in making the urban and country landscapes fit so well into the tenseness of the storytelling , while the widescreen is the perfect way to see this original thriller . brian cox's performance is simply brilliant , his hannibal is a most intelligent and frightening one , superior to anthony hopkins' campy portrayal of hannibal in the other versions . also , this scene was brilliantly filmed , as it was perfectly framed , showing in frightful details the similarity and gulf between these two antagonists , as they converse while in different cells . the stylish photography in this final scene , features mirrors , paintings , images , reflections , lunar landscapes , all pointing to the killer's urge to kill because he needs to be wanted and desired . this is an overlooked but superior horror film , one of the best films from the 1980s . the director's cut video has been released to coincide with the opening of hannibal . 
it's a grim tale filled with nostalgia , tenderness , and grief . the arrangement blossoms as jerry enjoys taking care of them and acting fatherly to the little girl . penn is to be commended for his nuanced shooting of the film and his confident way of telling the story through a retired detective who is becoming mentally unbalanced , and in the ambiguous ending that makes the viewer resolve the story as he thinks it should be . penn has directed a superb film , that is interestingly photographed and brings out fine performances from this sterling cast . many cast members gave cameo performances that fit the grey mood of this very emotionally felt film . it's one of the better murder mystery stories made , one that is more a psychological study of the detective than of the killer . it is more pertinent as a character study than as a murder investigation . 
one of the great silent films of all time . it was also one of the most offbeat psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio , especially one such as mgm . the collaboration between director/writer tod browning , himself a one time circus performer , and the intense performance by lon chaney , was a thing of magic . this was a vengeful , gruesome and scary scene . " the unknown " is a tightly made film , with a sinister plot and a startling and intense performance by chaney . the film presents an excellent study of character , though its theme is morbid and boiling with hatred it is still appealing because of its edginess . 
a top-notch film noir about the loneliness and despair in tinseltown , which is more a weighty drama story than a murder mystery . dix's idea of knowing you are in love is making breakfast for his girl , hardly a poetical romantic notion but more of the notion of love the common man might have . it's the kind of temperament that could swing across the pendulum from a loving warmth to an insane rage . dix is not a very pleasant noir character ; he's someone trapped in his dark emotions , left in a lonely place where he can't work out his problems and can only be viewed as someone who is too alienated to make positive relationships . i died when she left me . i lived a few weeks while she loved me . " 
an outstanding melodrama . it's a film noir that is influenced by freudian psychology , and was shot in 18 days by otto preminger . the result was that this was arguably her best film performance and otto , a known bully to actors , came up with an intelligent and exciting thriller . the film scores big because of the great nuanced performances from the stars robert mitchum and simmons , the sharp black and white photography contrasting the wealthy estate to mitchum's humble stature and rosy dreams , that the tale of obsessive love was credibly presented , and the typical noir tale of the protagonists getting hooked on sex and money gave the film the dark energy it thrived on . 
this is an unsentimental and marvelously acted family drama , set in a backwater dumpy australian seacoast town . the script by laura jones is intelligent and pertinent , the woman director gillian armstrong ( my brilliant career ) has made a nearly flawless film , and the three lead actresses draw out their complicated characters in ways that touch the heart with the mark of unbridled reality . the film doesn't flinch and tells the story without leaving a way out for any of the parties involved . it shows that a mother doesn't have to be perfect , she can have flaws as almost all do , but there's something about a child being raised by her real mother that means so much to both . there are no easy answers given here , what the film does best is concentrate on how this accidental meeting has a devastating effect on all three lives and it does it in a fresh way . judy davis is one of the best actresses around today , and her performance is powerful . this is just a brilliant film , my only quibble with it is a minor one . 
a top-rate film noir from the master , alfred hitchcock , that is more or less a twisted tale about love . it's also more erotic than the usual hitchcock ones , as long kissing scenes are duly noted . in fact , one scene was supposedly " the longest kiss onscreen in the history of films , '' taking three minutes in all . it was not , however , a single kiss , but broken up in three second intervals as censors observed . this memorable scene is in a class with the final one in casablanca . 
a brilliant and moving indie drama filmed on a shoestring budget of $400 , 000 , money allocated from the actors guild . maze mentioned that if he had to do it again , he would use guerrilla techniques allowing him to have a less glossy look but he would now have the ability to edit daily and reshoot scenes . as far as i could tell , there is only the abrupt happy ending i would expand on . otherwise , the film had an honest tension to it that made all these one take scenes seem honest , fresh and gripping . the film has not been released as of yet , but has been going around to film festivals . i saw it at the williamstown festival . that is the fifth and probably last festival it will play , as it either must find a distributor after a year of festivals or risk the possibility of never getting released . he mentioned that some cable tv networks might be interested in it if the nude scenes are removed . this prompted maze to jest that the film in order to get a release could be retitled " blind babe's boobs " in imitation of a hong kong film . whether it's acting or his life experience speaking , he is very genuine in this role and draws a very deep picture of someone losing a grip on himself . the film looked great because of its photography , its script was well thought out and intelligently done , and even though the actors were not household names they were all superb . marvel is known as an intellectual actress , someone who usually works in the theater and has garnished obie awards . incidentally , marvel and camp have a real-life longtime romantic relationship . this is a deeply emotional film with many complex layers to it , it is the kind of film that hollywood can't make because they believe there isn't an intelligent audience out there that want to see films like this one . that is precisely why such a heavy and intense film like this one , that takes risks and is unafraid that it does not fit into a niche market , deserves to be critically recommended so that it gets noticed by some distributor and has the possibility to reach a demanding audience that craves such worthy films . it is easily one of the better films i have seen this year . 
at last , a black comedy , coming-of-age , romantic melodrama about teenagers in rebellion that is not a formulaic clich ? d one and actually makes an attempt to flesh out the character of a teen who is searching for something that is not trivial , as she lashes back at being stuck in the urban sprawl scene of la that is inhabitated by so many shallow and phony people . it's filmed by documentary filmmaker terry zwigoff , a nerd himself , who gave us the excellent documentary crumb . she promises much to enid and , as one might expect , delivers little . it is one that seymour is willing to have even if it means he has to compromise all his beliefs to keep it going , as he curiously says " i don't want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests . " through his unapologetic loneliness she sees her own , and even though this film is not geared for a predictable or a happy ending , it's this relationship with all its incongruities that is so fascinating , touching and tender to behold . it certainly sharpened their awareness of who they were , and the poetical ending is fitting for a free flowing story like this one . i honestly can't remember how long its been since i have seen a teenage film as memorable as this one ( rushmore comes the closest ) . 
a truly magificent and authentic film set in the sparsely populated mountainous region of dolpo in northwest nepal . its appeal is both visually and in its compelling story about the tibetan villagers who live by their traditions . the cast is made up of mostly non-professionals who have not only not acted before , but some have never even seen a film . their wonderful expressive faces are reflective of the mountains and give the film its very appealing look . himalaya is noteworthy for its breathtaking shots of mountains that scale as high as 10 , 000 feet , as valli daringly shot this almost impossible mountain trek for nine months in all kinds of conditions--including a blinding winter snowstorm . it was shot in cinemascope using wide-angle panoramic framed shots and was nominated for an oscar as best foreign film , but lost to pedro almodovar's all about my mother . the story in its simplicity can be viewed as a fable about a generational conflict between a stubborn religious traditionalist set in his ways versus the younger man who is influenced by the pragmatism of modern ways and is just as pigheaded as his opponent . the film becomes in its second half an amazing visual spectacle and a challenge to the filmmaker to record the earnest story in the most difficult of locations , as it follows the two parties through the barren highland valleys and unsafe mountain passes . it's a testament to the spirit and courage of these followers of tibetan culture , who strive to carry on the traditions . it's ultimately a film about finding out who you are and about living in harmony with nature . i enjoyed it immensely and believe this rare film will be remembered for the simplicity of its very human story and the deep respect it has for a way of life that is endangered . if it wasn't a more penetrating look at the nepal villagers and their superstitions and if the drama wasn't more subtle--so be it ! that might be the task of another filmmaker . what this film did was show us a way of life that few have ever witnessed , and it did it in a spirited pictorial manner . 
it is about the effects of war on some taiwanese patriots and appears to be inaccessible until it slowly becomes clear what the masterful director is up to . the story is multi-layered as it uses as its theme the crimes against citizens during the anti-communist campaign waged during the 1950s , giving it a complexity that requires the viewer to have a resolve to stick with this gloomy tale that is shot with a static camera and takes place in three different time periods ( past , present , and in the imagination ) . the reward is seeing a great bit of filmmaking that comes from the heart . this is being enacted in a film starring liang ching . as the red army fought for control of china , chiang kai-shek -- supported by the americans -- rooted out all communists by force . the movie's title she's in is : good men , good women . the film offers much to ponder about the lessons from the past and how rotten both sides can be during war . it's a smoothly accomplished film of a 'film within a film , ' as it uses memories that are personal and those that are part of history to show how we can't easily distinguish the two . by the film's conclusion we feel the personal loss of both men who were killed , even though one might have been an innocent victim and the other might have got what he deserved . it's an unusual film that is always challenging and intelligent . annie shizuka inoh in the role of these women from different generations , gives an inspiring performance that evokes a genuine sympathy . 
how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life ; that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself ? " for that reason , seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself , and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited , it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works , an intriguing masterpiece , that is equal to , if not better than his other masterpieces , solaris , andrei rublyov , the sacrifice , and mirror . the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgin's body are , indeed , startling . the mood of the film is gloomy , when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope . the feeling one gets , is somewhat as if a child , saddened by the outside world , is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up , and thereby feels good about himself . when the sacristan's response is , " what are you here for , then ? " the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman . the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature , but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn , they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend . for tarkovsky , this film is a lifetime journey , made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is , because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him . things do not seem so foreign to him , anymore . 
melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner . i suspect , not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life . . . melville's sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late 40s , and that list would include the great director , bresson , who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville , who at times outdoes melville's melville , giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson . melville's success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent , and allowing it to be emotionally compelling . his argument for a god couldn't be put forth with more verve and intelligence , even though it didn't convince me , as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion , nevertheless , this film moved me to further expand what i think . . . it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church , something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema . 
goldfish , for the iranian celebrants , are symbols of life . what is truly amazing about this masterly done film , is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year , that is marked off by repeated radio reminders . by this time , we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl , it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts , whether or not the gifts are worth it or not , they have an intrinsic value above their real worth , and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts . the brilliance of the film , is that the story that unfolds is about the little girl's adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does , and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story ; it is something that is universally understood , that we forget that we are talking about iran , the country that we demonized , our arch enemy ; and , if the film can be criticized , it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not . though , i think , that might be unfair to say , since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons . this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air , that is not contrived or pretentious , but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film , topping off a very human film , that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran . the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity , and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved ; and , how childhood is explored , pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity , are unmatched in most hollywood films . if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen , i think of de sica's the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
a wonderful noir-type of film , that is actually more about style and ambiance than it is about what usually underlines the dark themes of the ticklish noir film subjects , that delve into the underbelly of their protagonist and evoke a certain sense of injustice in the world . all that is superfluous to bob the gambler ; in this film , he is more interested in taking care of his trenchcoat and fedora and giving hand-outs to those he likes , than he is in doing anything else but looking good . this is so much a movie about how the young and old can be screw-ups but are still okay with themselves , seemingly daring life to keep them from what they want to be . by the film's end we are convinced that we know a lot about bob , and come to the conclusion that he's a pretty good guy , thinking to ourselves , even though he is linked to gambling and crime , nevertheless , he does possess a wonderful character about him , something that is worthy of our praise . a great film , that is shot with perfection , capturing the nuances and finesse a master film-maker brings to his work , while shooting a low-budget b/w film , that tells a simple story , but is done with such effervescence , as to make us feel so much the better that we at least met this perfectly flawed character , even if it is only on film , since , for most of us , it is more than likely we will not have the chance to meet the likes of a true character like him in person . 
rivette has created a work of art from a short balzac story about art , " the unfinished masterpiece . " it is just something she does so she could be independent of nicolas . la belle noiseuse , which we are told , is the title of the masterpiece , is about a 17th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out , who is referred to as being someone who is a " ball-buster . " what makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work , are scenes such as these , where one's sense of time is lost , and the length of the picture , ( it is 240 minutes ) does not seem wasted even for a minute , as we watch and become part of the creation , starting from scratch , and actually are hearing the artist's scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants , even when she complains that he is hurting her . frenhofer is stuck . he is filled with self-doubt if he can ever paint again . marianne asks him , " why " me " naked in front of you , why not liz " ? she goes on to say , " i need to understand this " . . . it seems the situation has reached a point of no return . every character is now playing out his emotional trump cards . there is a hint of a possible affair that might have taken place between balthazar and her ten- years ago , that seems to be the cause of the tension we feel among the three of them . liz says , " for freno , it is the art of it , it is the capturing of a whole life in a painting--- it is that thing that makes art shameless , that is what matters to him . it is as if one can see one's whole life passing in a flash , like it might be for a person drowning . " so the camaraderie between the two artists seems to be genuinely plausible , in the sense , that they do understand each other , that is , as far as their work goes . with freno , in the position of control in his life , he is able to patronizingly say to nicolas as he departs , " i like you , don't ever change . " the last shot is with the agent , talking numbers with frenhofer , deciding how much they will get for the masterpiece . the acting is exceptionally good by everyone . piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing , while emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent , offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses . the only thing that struck me as odd , is that the final masterpiece drawn , supposedly by bernard dufour , did not appear to me to be a masterpiece , but a rather ordinary work . the picture itself is the masterpiece ; that is , the creative process itself , was convincingly done , by a director who has the skills and knowledge to tell such a story and never allow the story to be wavering from its lofty position of significance , as anything but an honest intellectual effort , a search for the truth within . 
reportedly , satyajit ray said , of all the films he directed , that this was his favorite . at one point of the film , his face turns to glee as he is in his newspaper's press room and he exclaims that he just loves the smell of the ink press , there is nothing better in the world than that smell . there is a certain feeling to this b/w illustriously cinematographed film , that reflects the belief ray has , that life is a continual rhythm of birth and death , one is complete because of the other . what this is a film that is visually poetic , stunning in its apperceptive recognitions of life in the raw , without any wasted movement exerted , with expressive gestures counting for unsaid dialogue and untold physical encounters replaced by a nuance , such as , by a romantic notion , as charu has on a swing , just by a toss of her head upwards and she is seen in a swoon , and a deliberate word from her will slowly be turning into a potion that is magically brewing , as it is taking charge of all her pent-up emotions , as we imagine that we actually can see what is taking place inside the heads of the would-be lovers , even if nothing explicit materializes . 
he is of such a good nature , that he can't stand to argue with anyone or ask for something , even if it is rightfully his , putting all his fate in god . satyajit ray's old-fashioned and slow developing film , graced with the sublime sitar ragas of ravi shankar , is unpretentious and starkly beautiful in its depiction of the human condition just as it is , giving relevance to the lives of these ordinary people , without the need to be arty about it , as the characters find in their hearts how best to transcend the situation they are in . this film should be a magical lesson in film-making for those modern filmmakers who think they must inject heavy doses of symbolism to get their point across . 
he was just twenty-nine years- old and had made two brilliant feature films , zero conduct and this film . l'atalante is , perhaps , considered by some , a dated film as far as its style goes . but with that being said , there is no denying that it is still powerful viewing because of its magically developed poetical gestures to the subject of love and the refreshingly lyrical way it looks out at its surrounding seascape towns and at the human condition . the ordinary couple are playing out their vexing emotions without letting on how much these emotions mean to them , until it is almost too late . because their emotions and passions are so dominating , the quality of the film engulfs everyone aboard the barge in an unreal state . the seine looks so much like a dreamworld , where those on it are just drifting . because the story is such a simple one and the couple in so ordinary , it is not the story in itself that is exhilerating , as much as the way the film moves us to look at our own lives , with all its possibilities and disappointments . it makes us see things in a way that is disarmingly enchanting . that despite the moroseness and daily grind of regular life , there is also a poetical and romantic mood , waiting to be tapped . we makes his film an out-of-this world cinematic experience that sublimely lingers in our consciousness . the film version to see , which is now on video , is the restored 1990 one , that pierre philippe and jean-louis bompoint recovered missing footage for . the film is now more decipherable from the botched up initial showing of the film , that was not well received by the paris audience . it is good to see vigo's almost original version of the film resurrected , at last , and look so stunningly beautiful in black-and-white . 
in any case , he has accomplished a work of exquisite visual craftsmanship , another fitting feather in the cap for one of the most original innovators in cinema today . his sharp photographic images intermingled with some grainy shots and his never static camera angles ( reminiscent of ones used in his other films ) and his use of different shades of light to transpose his visions from a dream world to reality , give the film a magical look , capturing and sweeping us into its grand design . it is a film that unfolds like a dream , whereby it is to be viewed with eyes wide shut . the film's opening immediately engages us in its sexuality : the tall , curvaceous lady peeling off her black dress with her back to us , is nicole kidman , and the next shot fades to darkness , it is as if the curtain was pulled down on a sex show and we are told that now that we have seen her lovely ass , the rest is up to our imagination . the show is over ; we can make of it what we want . the intricate telling of their relationship involves the dreams they have , a ceremonial orgy he attends , nudity-including his viewing and kissing of a corpse for a long few moments , a jealous marital relationship to tweak our morbid curiosity , and an obtuse ending that should satisfy those who can't accept tidy endings in their films . make no mistake about it , sex is their problem . kubrick , bless his courage , will stick to this obsessive theme , not giving an inch of leeway for any other reason , from the alpha to the omega of the film . and to his credit , it is that intensity that gives the story fuel to propel itself and work its way into the understanding we have of the chemistry and dynamics in the relationship the two have . a picture perfect relationship that is shown to be already not perfect after the first five minutes of the film . that cruise is nearly perfect for the part ( the only slight negative thing about his performance was that his constant cell phone action reminded me too much of the jerry maguire character ) , as he displays a wide range of emotions and ability , to be a turd and then come back and be human again , is the kind of acting he hasn't been required to do so far in his career , but with the wonderful relationship he developed with stanley , he is able to understand who he is and be able to be convincing as a young doctor for the rich and as a dye-in-the-wool materialist , committed to being a doctor and intelligent enough to see changes in his life as necessities . the entire cast is superb . the this scene is sheer brilliance , one of the best kubrick has ever done , it is a scene that is so humanly emotional , something that his naysayers said he could never do ; the acting catches all the nuances of a real and fictious relationship , something that an inexperienced acting duo could not have done so effortlessly and made it seem so impactful . what made the streets particularly foreboding was the skillful manipulation of lights to reflect either a dream or reality world he was in , with the penetrating brightness of the neon emanating from the clubs and storefronts making them look like sites from hell . the slide down a decadent path for the couple ends mirthfully , but on a seemingly depersonalized note , as alice's answer to everything is a resounding let's f * * * . this film has all the earmarks of a masterpiece despite its let down in certain spots : is the cruise character worth all the fuss over saving ? is kubrick's overtly homosexual characterization of a desk clerk gratuitous or necessary to show that cruise attracts both men and women to him ? it is probably a film that has to be seen a few times before its characterizations fully sink in and the power of its story can be fully appreciated . the whole societal process of how dehumanized we have all become is opened up for further speculation , as sex our most intimate response to love is dehumanized and played out in the need for an orgy . this two day whirlwind the couple has might be the beginning of who knows what , and that is scary , as most people want some reassurances about their future . a thinking man's work of art has evolved , and a very splendid film to end the century on , as well as to end the career of one of our most distinguished directors . in this film's case , all the hype the film got did not work against it . 
the country itself was a bit paranoid during this tense period of the cold war . as technology used in the wrong way was no laughing matter , a nuclear war was a strong possibility . that this film is able to exploit that craziness of attitudes prevailing and make a stinging satirical comedy out of it , a film that is not pass ? , even as of today , in 1999 , after 35 years , speaks volumes for its satirical power . the nature of the film is irreverence for those who are involved in building up this nuclear conflict . a theme of inhumanity kubrick kept intact throughout his film career , even in his last film , eyes wide shut . . . this is one of the greatest political satires , if not the greatest ever made . a not to be missed film . 
simply put , this is one of the best crime films ever made . especially considering that it was made on a budget of only $230 , 000 . it most closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great french directors jean-pierre melville and jacques becker , as a classic noir tale depicting man's foibles of greed and betrayal . the the robbery itself is told in multiple flashback style , as each character gets a chance to tell his version of the story , which is done in parts , so that each character's story is not only told but the film is able to jump back and forth in time , allowing for several events to happen together . she also clearly had the two best lines in the film : if people didn't have headaches , what would happen to the aspiren industry ? what makes this film so tense and gripping , is the exacting details that went into making this caper work , as it is seen through the eyes of the odd mixture of characters who commit the robbery . the point made , is a theme that kubrick will return to many times in his long career in films , that their perfect robbery fails because of the human condition they couldn't control and not because the robbery wasn't perfectly executed . it fits in with kubrick's notion of life : that it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the game does . as one of kubrick's early features , it remains one of his greatest films , even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour into his later high-budget , more complex movies . the outstanding cast made everything look natural , and the gritty realism of the story was only enhanced by the glorious b/w cinematography . 
john ford's epic western about america and its racial past , is the quintessential american film about what it once meant to be american , more than any other film that i could think of , and that includes citizen kane . it is ford's best , one that is much more than the western it appears to be ; it is a film that is eventually about self-discovery , seen symbolically through the eyes of one man , john wayne . there is not one single actor in the world who could have played this part better than wayne . in the opening scene , he is only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay , even when idolized by the children . ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the indians . that he hates indians so much , yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways , more so than he does with white society , makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them . his story is visceral poetry , a tragedy that turns ridiculous , as ford wanted it to be , and it has unexpected psychological twists to it that can be read into the story by one's own relationship with america . it is hard not to substitute his hatred for indians into a hatred for blacks , and it is easy to see how wayne's soul could be construed as america's soul . make no mistake about it , this is not an ordinary or very good western , this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema , one that many of the early 1950s film critics couldn't see . it is not that it is a particularly profound movie , but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future . over-the-years , the status of this film has grown immeasurably , to the point that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene , along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness . if there was a more perceptive western made , one that captured the visions of america better , i have not seen such a film . if there is such a film out there , i will take the liberty of using wayne's favorite retort in the film : " that'll be the day . " 
2001 : a space odyssey is a meditative quest , an inspirational sci-fi film that defies its genre in scope and attitude , it is a film of tremendous visual impact and innovation . this was done before star wars and at time when sci-fi films were were mostly low-budget productions . it is kubrick's masterpiece . a film that encourages our contemplation of every scene , as each was carefully and intelligently shot with that in mind , as it is only through our own effort can we come away with an understanding of the film . hal is even programed with human emotions , but we are not certain if these emotions are genuine . this has been interpreted by many , that kubrick has made a pessimistic film about the inevitable conflict with man and his machines , but it just might be that what he is saying , is we better not rely completely on machines , no matter how infallible they may appear to be . the first half-hour of the film is filled with splendid silence , showing the apes doing their destructive thing , and it takes about an hour into the film before the plot starts to develop , as the infamous bone is thrown into the air by the ape and the scene slowly dissolves into one showing a space shuttle , as we zoom into a space terminal and hear our first words in the film . it is as if the baton is passed to the higher order of beings , saying we got you so far , can you take us all the way home , across the finish line of evolution . the tedious pace of the film has a hypnotic affect , contrasting the primitive beastiality of our ancestors with the polite deceptions of our future relatives . the johann strauss waltz " blue danube , '' which accompanies the docking of the space shuttle and the space station , is deliberately slow , and thereby offers no resistance to the non-action taking place on screen . while richard strauss' " thus spake zarathustra " , provided energy and vitality to the space flight and became the film's very popular signature theme . all this presents a rather rosy picture of what high tech can do for us ; that is , if we play our cards right and don't do something stupid , like blow up the world . what kubrick pays most attention to , is the spacecraft's design and the terminal's details , as they are shown as if they were placed under a microscope and examined by us to see if we can pick up any faults in them . as they heed what dr . floyd warns , " this mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it , by telling you before hand what it is about . '' that science is held up as the finder of our truths , was never more ably said . kubrick seems to be delivering a sound message to politicians , scientists and theologians , alike . the aliens who created this environment are not shown , as the film ends very mysteriously , which has been a source of lots of commentary , and has inspired meanings-- from it's all rubbish-- to-- something divine has happened . this film , ultimately , is about the need mankind has to transcend his limited thinking and move into dimensions that are greater than his narrow aims . it is not a pessimistic film , as some have suggested , neither is it an optimistic film ; it is a film based on self-discovery and intellect and contemplation . it is one of the great original works of cinema , maybe even the best ; it is a film that is not even a bit dated as i view it once again in 1999 , still awed by the spectacle and mystery of it . 
even with a minimal amount of conversations taking place , the characters were seen dancing and horsing around , as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a natural manner . in reality , this never occurred in vietnam ; but , it is used by cimino as a necessary metaphor to show how insane the war is . this one-shot theory when it is used for deer hunting , can be seen as something sensible , as if it reflects true sportsmanship . this film offers a very puzzling and complex moral take on the war and on those who were directly affected by it , as cimino makes no apology for the volunteer soldiers fighting a bad war , he only revels in how poignant michael's odyssey is-for he is the hero of this story and the most compelling one in it-but even he can't feel at home after his adventure , his war experiences were too mind-boggling for him to even talk about what is bothering him . what makes this film exceptional , one of the best films of the '70s , is not the story , which is good but not great , and not the cinematography , which is pleasing in scope but doesn't break new ground in its camera work . it is the performers themselves who take the story to spell-binding heights and make this a great film , making you care enormously about the characters they play . de niro gives a riveting performance as he searches for meaning to his life , making his patriotism seem genuine and his participation in a war that made no sense to a lot of people , something that needs no apology , just like his deer kill is done like a true sportsman would do it ; that is , if you must kill a deer , at least , do it the right way . streep's performance is more subtle , as her facial expressions give way to the great psychological strain she is under , not sure of what is happening to her , but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life . john savage is convincing as a good guy who got a few bad breaks in life and couldn't fully recover from it . walken won an oscar as a supporting actor , in a film that won a total of five oscars , including those for best picture , editing , sound , and director . the remainder of the cast added to the haunting feeling that this was a tale of significant moral and political weight . cazale's performance as a weasel , staying out of the war , hiding behind a phony macho persona , is a fitting one , in contrast to the guys who enlisted . it is an astonishing film . a one of a kind experience . the stupidity of the war and all its atrocities , as it is stunningly presented by the filmmaker , leaves one without a chance to escape the moral implications of the war or does it give one a chance to recapture a lost innocence . the filmmaker seems to be saying , you can run away from vietnam and try to avoid it , but you can't get completely away from it , its devastation touched every part of america , and this film , whose viewpoint is not taken from the liberal side of the political spectrum , as anti-war films usually are , but wants to respect the opinions of conservative working -class america , the one's who sent their sons to fight this war . and what the film offers as a poignant reminder about war , even as it is a testament to the soldiers of the war , is how the war harmed even those who coolly survived it , and how it left the american psyche scarred for life . 
carl theodor dreyer's emotionally intense masterpiece , the passion of joan of arc , soundly evokes the passion and resonance of france's heroine , the soul of her country , who was burned at the stake in 1431 for being a heretic and then in 1920 was made a saint , as if time can heal such wounds . not relying on the standard techniques used in silent films during that time frame , nor on the avant-garde and surrealist's vision of the radical 1920s on debunking the church , the danish filmmaker , dreyer , concentrated on making an intensely personal film , a film that eluded any known styles . the passion of joan of arc featured many close-ups of joan ( ren ? e maria falconetti ) and the judges , and used the symbols of the church to show the extent of its authority . though the film appeared to be shot without any long and medium shots , that was not the case . it just seemed that way because dreyer , for reasons of getting at the truth without any other interference , had made isolated shots of joan , showing how alone she was from her accusers , and from the soldiers and peasants watching the trial , and these shots became abstractions , allowing you to think of them as being solely close-ups . it is because of this style that we are forced to concentrate only on the main players and on the truth of the trial , and our attention is not diverted in any other direction . the genius of dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it was . he picked her because under her skin-deep beauty and makeup he saw her soul and the simplicity of her nature . no actor wore makeup , every attempt was made to make things seem as natural as possible . dreyer was rewarded with his choice for actress , by getting from her one of the greatest magical performances ever seen in the history of films . falconetti , interestingly enough , never made another film , but instead chose to go back to doing light comedies on the stage , except for a brief respite , where she repeated her joan role on the french stage . the rest of his casting was also inspired , this time by a mixture of professional actors and those chosen in the bistros , as he opted to cast for his english general , warwick , someone who in real-life was a cafe-keeper . the film's opening is a study in starkness . the contrasts between the two shots will be a recurring theme of the film : historical events will seem to be eternal . joan : " i know nothing about that . joan : when i have done what god sent me to do i shall resume wearing a woman's dress . " the filmmaking of the trial was so austere ; it was easy to believe that this was the actual trial taking place . the scene was so intense , that when it was being shot , all the stagehands brought her flowers on that occasion , and dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful it was . the film's spiritual sense of being is layed in the moral rectitude of joan and her willingness not to forego suffering . what captures one's imagination about dreyer's version of joan- and this film is almost completely his version- as he all but ignored joseph delteil's slight novel on which the film was based on- is that dreyer recognized that joan ultimately took a stand for all those who are opposed to social authority and who are determined to be true to their own nature and are prepared to offer whatever self- sacrifice is required . in contrast , is the honest gaze exhibited from the close-up of joan , who seems to be so much the better of a person than those pack of phonies she is forced to look at and be condemned by , that we are forced to see how the faces of evil are contrasted with the face of a good person , and dreyer's abstractions , of sticking to the shot he takes until you see what you have to see , until it grows on you , leaving you with a feeling of real sorrow as she is finally burned at the stake , in a trial that seemed in the film as if it took a day or two , but went on for about five months , in actuality . this is one of the most memorable films ever made , one that is hard to forget , as it ends on the bleakest of notes , with joan burned at the stake in front of a group of grieving spectators . 
jim jarmusch ( stranger than paradise/permanent vacation/ down by law/ mystery train/night on earth ) has directed and written a poetically unique and disturbing western , one that is an american masterpiece , and is clearly one of the best films of the '90s . the electrical guitar played and scored by neil young , complements the eerie mood of the film , as young's improvised melodic theme is repeated with different strains and variations to it throughout . the film could also be viewed as if one were reading a book of poems , as each scene is separated by a blackout , which allows the next scene to be read as a new poem or viewed as a new development in the film , one that is not necessarily related to the previous scene . this film is viewed on the side of the outsider , the loner , and the visionary , who have the wherewithal to see through all the violence that america is built around in its pursuit of happiness and economic comfort . aside from jarmusch's deadpan humor , the dreamlike intonations , the psychedelics , and the surreal camerawork ( a beautifully shot black-and-white film by robby m ? ller slowly unfolding , that catches hold of the deathlike odyssey sequences and the superb imagery of the landscape ) , but also relates a strong history lesson and a colorful mystical tour of the death experience that adds an especially vibrant visionary sense to this stunning and problematical film . blake's destination point , is a squalid place , with no redeeming features or common civility about it . this is an original film , the kind that you are not likely to see being made from those box office watching directors and those studio heads who wouldn't know a real visionary work even if the real william blake was to appear before them and shout his poems into their ears . what makes this film particularly exciting , that allows it to have such a real-blakeian feel about it , is when some of those magnificent blake-like aphorisms are dropped into the film , such as when nobody says , " the eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow . " this fits easily into the flow and grace of this perfectly made film , where nobody can say " you don't stop the clouds by building a ship , " and that could either be taken for an old indian saying , or something nobody made up , or one of blake's sayings from his " songs of innocence " and " songs of experience . " the most remarkable aspect about this film , is not only that it didn't falsely romanticize the western settler and idolize him for how good he was with a gun , as most films foolishly do , but it debunked that whole western john ford type of liberal myth , that the cowboy was doing all that violence to advance civilization , that if the indian can be civilized he can and should live with the white man . that sort of feeling those films conveyed , coming only from the white man's patronizing position of superiority , left a lot to be desired , even if ford in his masterpiece " the searchers " did tune in to the inherent racism in america , he still couldn't convey with the kind of depth this film does , how the indian viewed the white man . in this pyschedelic western film , blake and nobody are almost complete opposites , contraries if you will , borrowing from one of the bard's adages of how best to gain wisdom . humor is sometimes a saving grace when all else fails and that is what is indisputably working here , in the odd relationship between the two travelers ; and , even if what jarmusch's well-researched , historically accurate film was delving at , is not always clear to some of the viewers , as the establishment critics who dutifully lambasted this film because they said they didn't get it , even though , they say that they laud the poetry of blake , but still hated the film for its murkiness ( i feel these are the same sorts that called blake a madman in his lifetime and said his work was rubbish , and i am not surprised in the least at their negativity toward this original film ) . the film had energy ; and energy , blake said , is 'eternal delight . ' it also has a prophetic message for the modern technological age , and that message is that all is not rosy if we continue to destroy the planet and ourselves . it's not that cool a thing to just shoot people , as portrayed in so many popular action films , films that think they have to substitute action for image . 
stanley kubrick's first big financed a film and first film with a major hollywood star . kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it . this antiwar film , one of the best ever made , much like renoir's masterpiece " the grand illusion , " does a great job of criticizing the role of the french military higher-ups in ww1 . the movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the officer's political manuevering for power . kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and gritty than renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war . one reason why this was so , was because it hit harder at those who were its subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to officially oppose the film . it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval . kubrick , reportedly , wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing to forgo artistic integrity . the controversial ending might be termed a cop-out by many , while others found its sentimentalities quite appropriate and cynical enough . incidentally , in my opinion , the major flaw in paths of glory wasn't the taut script , which was lucid and hard-hitting , but it was in kirk douglas's egomaniacal performance ( though a strong performance and the best one in kirk's career ) . but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war . kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems . he accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is corrupting . we are told that world war i has dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified trenches and heavy casualties . war but then broulard says that a promotion awaits , there will be consideration for another star . after dax says it is not possible to do , mireau says , " show me a patriot and i'll show you an honest man . " but mireau , not to be undone in the generosity of the moment , says let's make it 3 and have the 701st's three commanding officers choose one from each outfit . broulard says we better get a court-martial for them and make it legal . angrily , dax turns him down , as broulard looks at him incredulously , as if he were a fool , saying you really cared about saving those three men , you are an idealist . dax tells him to give the men a few minutes . the film is direct and powerful . it wouldn't have been banned for so long if it didn't hit home with its hard message . it is magnificently shot , as the trenches are frighteningly real and incomprehensible to understand until seen . kirk douglas is overwhelming in his stabilizing role , in my opinion too much so . but , nevertheless , his anger is warranted , as he is the emotional glue that holds the film together and gives humanity some measure for hope . though i came away from the film feeling no hope . i was cynical of everyone's motives , including dax's . to call him a hero , as the ending of the film implies by its crass sentimentality , as it shows him going back to the front , left me cold . adolphe menjou and george macready came through with outstanding performances , each one an incarnation of machiavellian evil . when on screen , their performances are like machine gun fire directed at you . there is much to chew on idea-wise , despite how simple the film might appear on first viewing it , and thereby lies its true greatness , as it seems to make a timeless argument against war ; and , as in most kubrick films , it is not dated , in fact , it seems to get better with age . 
a splendidly chilling noir tale about murder , immorality , lust , and greed . the three stars are all magnificent . the director , billy wilder , an austrian ? migr ? , is in top form , as this film was made before he became too leery of hollywood and became more cynical than hard-boiled . it was wilder himself who made the script so taut , relying on the drunken chandler for limited support , as he was too inebriated to work on the script but very skilled in making the dialogue sparkle . the result of wilder's efforts to streamline the story and keep it obsessive , is a film that can make you sweat . its dark and moody cinematography is brilliantly shot by john seitz , setting up the hypnotic rhythmical flow of the story , as narrated by macmurray's noir-like voiceover . if all that wasn't enough to make this one of the best noir films ever , add on the odd attraction the two killers have for each other and the genuine relationship between the macmurray and robinson characters , which is almost father and son like , plus you got a film that perfectly captures the dark atmosphere of the prewar los angeles scene . i didn't get the money . and i didn't get the woman . '' while she seems to be without a heart , a cold and bitter femme fatale , who , at first look , seems to be at blame for what transpired . but , on another look , it seems as if chance played a great part in the tragedy that was to happen , as the two combustible personalities were alike more than what they at first realized , and their chance encounter set everything in motion . they will carry off a murder that they probably wouldn't have done if they just thought about what they were doing and what they really wanted . there is a genuine love between them , but they are both too caught up in portraying the hardened men they want to appear as , than to recognize their very tender needs . it would have been a perfect crime , but then too many questions kept popping up . this interest in lola is refreshing for him , he finds that he would rather be with her than with phyllis . i'm rotten to the heart . i used you , just as you said . that's all you ever meant to me . until a minute ago , when i couldn't fire that second shot . " neff a running gag throughout the film , is that neff continually lights the cigars of the " matchless " keyes . as wilder's perverse sense of humor , supports the film's grim conclusion , that both phyllis and neff were not criminals in the real sense of being criminals , but were weak-minded individuals , unhappy with their lives , who succumbed to their human failings . wilder's original ending of having neff die in the gas chamber was scrubbed by him as being unnecessary , so we'll never know if that ending was more powerful than the present one . wilder told an interviewer that neff's death was among " two of the best scenes i've ever shot in my whole life " ( the other being the sunset boulevard opening ) . what this ending left was a question mark , as i wondered why neff returns to the office to confess to keyes , if what he really wanted to do was to escape . take note of their last comments : " you know why you couldn't figure this one , keyes ? i'll tell you . because the guy you were looking for was too close--right across the desk from you . '' keyes says , " closer than that , walter , '' and then neff says , ``i love you , too . '' 
in this film , about a child-murderer , his first talkie , it was made with surprisingly the highest sound quality , which is quite an achievement if you keep in mind how this was his first experience with that new medium . new york , 1947 , lang stated why he has such an avid interest in murder : " gradually , and at times reluctantly , i have come to the conclusion that every human mind harbors a latent compulsion to murder . " you can chalk " m " up as a lasting masterpiece , created with a passion for detail and a successful transitional film from the silents to the talkies , taking into its mise en scene the best of both those worlds . at its best , " m " emulates the accomplishments found in all the great works of poetry . it is still the greatest of all the serial killer films made , even if it is mistakeningly considered by some , now , as merely a museum piece . all you have to do is compare the depth of its storytelling with the greatest films of that genre , a genre that lang's film spawned , such as psycho and the silence of the lambs . and , when you compare it to a slick thriller , like the recent american psycho , it is not difficult to see how shallow that one is in comparison . this tune will become the ominous leitmotif throughout the film . since lorre couldn't whistle , it was lang's whistling that was used . it is evident that lang saw here the festering wounds nazism would later on fully exploit to its own advantages , in a society that was already decadent and had lost its sense of responsibility . what gives this film its power , is how the entire city is analyzed by how they react to the crime . the film is expeditious in its stark treatment of the innocuous lorre , who does not stand out from the crowd and is physically a small and fragile man . he finally screams out , getting the pity of a few , " i have no control over my urges . i want to escape from myself , but it is impossible . " 
writer/director john sayles weaves an intriguing story that is both a mystery and a study about the relationship between the generations and the races . this is a slow moving , superbly acted , thoughtful , provocative look at america's past and where it is now , as seen through the past lives of the main characters depicted in the three ethnic communities . the laconic tone of the film and the strong intellect in the script bring so many other things to the table , that the mystery , even though it is followed through and wrapped up , is not quite as important as all the other issues it brings up . the subtle message being that the past must be remembered but it is more important that the future must not be blurred by what already happened and can't be changed . this ambitious project is an engrossing and an original work . there are no predictable and formulaic messages , this is one of the great films of the 1990s , one that is done with wit and tact . everything about it rings with truth , even if it has to break down a few legends to get its point across -- proving that often enough , legends are not all they are cracked up to be . 
this neglected low-budget b/w noir film from the 1950s is a beaut , an absolutely superb thriller . it reminds me so much of jean-pierre melville's great existentialist character studies he presented in his noir films , such as in le samurai ( 67 ) , where the point of the film remains less on the story and more on how the protagonist is suave and calculatingly dispassionate . claude is ready to give up , saying the woman is a jinx , you can't go against a jinx or you end up dead . this is a perfectly nuanced film , with the atmospheric noir cinematography by lucien ballard , plus a brilliantly appropriate one-man guitar musical arrangement heard in the background . the film also had a beautiful feel for who the character is and the situation he was in , as there were no phony contrivances , as everything about this film felt natural . they don't make noir films better than this . interestingly enough , the director and screenwriter never went on to something even close to the quality this b film achieved , while this role deservedly catapulted vince edwards career into stardom . 
since the film didn't have a director , the film's star , charlton heston , suggested to the people at universal that they get orson to direct it ( this is heston's version ) . it was magnificently photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades as filmed by the great cinematographer russell metty , which abetted the imaginative tale , whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy , obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by orson . it's a b-film more powerful and hard-boiled than the weak-minded upper-studio heads at universal could handle . the video that came out in the '70s was an interpretation of the three re-edited versions , which was far removed from the way orson wanted it seen . the film ended up as a box office disappointment , giving ammo to those in hollywood who said that he could only make an art film and not a commercial one . orson refused to recognize the version that universal sent to the movie theaters as his film , in fact he called it an 'odious thing . ' never fully receiving the recognition that the film should have gotten for the masterpiece it was , it was even considered by some film critics to be a disappointing welles film , not comparable to his masterpiece of " citizen kane . " the film , nevertheless , got recognized abroad , especially by the french new wave directors and eventually the film was starting to get a following among young intellectuals in this country and started to get its just recognition for the poetically visionary and original film it was . it was a film that did things films never did before , both technically and as a hard-hitting baroque thriller . it was the first film to have natural dialogue in a moving car . it is arguably the greatest opening shot in film history because of its visual impact in setting up the feature's characters and the tenseness of the story that was to follow . orson used a hand-held camera and specialized not only in wide-angle shots but by his constant intercutting , he was able to keep the action flowing and the story suspenseful . the film had been restored somewhat by 1978 for its video distribution and it picked up some running time from how it was first shown at 96 minutes and now it was back to its original time of 108 minutes . in the 1990s the film was finally pieced together from the memo orson sent the studio and the hack director's scenes were cut , and it picked up an additional three minutes . the effort to restore the film to the way orson originally shot it , allowed the story to become clearer and for the film to have the shape the artist wanted it to have . this is about the closest we could get to the way orson filmed it , since he passed away in 1985 and we have no other idea about what else he may have wanted to do with the film . spoiler : for those who don't want to follow the rest of the story , please stop reading at this point and resume reading the last paragraph , which makes some further points about the film . the subtle beauty of this scene , is in the restored version , where it looks as if the machine killed him . fans of the cinema should be pleased with this restored work and after seeing it will have a chance to judge for themselves which version is the masterpiece . there should be no doubt about what that choice should be . for cinefiles , thanks must go out to those who put in such a worthwhile effort to get this restoration accomplished . 
claire denis ( i can't sleep/nenette and boni/no fear , no die ) has created a cinematic work of great poetry and reverie : a masterpiece . there are many films that influenced denis , but the works of alain renais , especially his muriel , probably influenced her the most . it's a film so visually stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations , and most of all , in its lyrical sensuality , that it runs poetically adrift with its listless hypnotic pace , its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to see what is not being said , and by its strange brooding mood it sets , as it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate , alienation and envy through the eyes of the narrow-minded french foreign legionnaire who found freedom in his remorse . its background shots are just as important as its story line and its theme , as it helps explore the everyday boredom the men face , of the trite routines the macho men are under , and the underlying violence it evokes in them . the minimally told story is made all the more powerful by many vivid shots , such as the one of the emerald water contrasted with the barren desert , or of the distant mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us of things we cannot know , or of the unobtrusive native women in their colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco , who strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones . the local women are just as much a part of the story as anything else in the film is , even though they are not directly part of the plot . there are also the close-ups of the interracial legionnaires living as brothers who have to reinforce this by ritualistically hugging and separating from each other in what seems to be weirdly homoerotic embraces , but can also be viewed as a parody of such romantic notions . beau travail literally means beautiful work , and this film delivers all that and more . it seems like it has been ages since i have been so enthused about a film as i am by this one . i have a lot of time ahead of me . ' galoup is not afraid to openly state how he was driven by the twisted state of his mind to behave in such a maddening way against such a selfless and blank individual , someone he found hard to believe really exists . time seems irrelevant for the soldiers , memories seem to come and go , as they do their military drills looking at times like teutonic mythical gods while half-naked ( these scenes provoke , mock and remind us of the leni riefenstahl kitsch art and homoerotic heroes she gave us in both triumph of the will and olympiad--though denis's characterizations seemed all the more potent , purposeful and vital ) . to iron a perfect crease in their uniform is part of their reason for being in the legion , because it makes them look special . beau travail is the memories of such idol pleasures and such a need to fit in somewhere , even if it is into something that appears as useless as the legion , which doesn't seem to have any purpose anymore without the days of french colonization and the algerian war . the legion is their love fantasy , it is something that can't be understood by anyone but true lovers . this is her breakthrough genius film , a film that stands heads and shoulders over the talented director's other films . what adds to the film , is the robust musical score of benjamin britten's billy budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who played a legionnaire , bernardo montet . all the military exercises were like watching a ballet , as the entire film had the fresh look of something so beautiful , that it has to be seen . 
the young kid doesn't know what to say . yang-yang is not only the namesake of the director , but speaks for him in this film . so how can i know what you see ? " at one point of the film the director through the character who reacts the most emotional , the very thin " fatty , " tells his movie date that movies are not a waste of time , but enrich one's life . they even increase your life three times because the movies tell us about things we could never possibly know . he gives one example of murder , but that didn't go over too well with ting-ting . this one is a masterpiece , despite it being as inexplicable as a great work of music sometimes is . it lays out the grief facing a problematic family and we see it happening , but we never quite understand why ; and , we will have to accept as an answer that is because individuals are very complex and if they can't tell us what is on their mind , we can only guess what they are thinking . and , isn't that the way you find it with many people ? maybe finding happiness isn't so simple a matter . maybe we are destined to follow a certain course and even if given a second chance would still make the same mistakes . the director knows that we are all unique and have our own way of seeing things , and he respects that . but whatever , there was a certain raw , undefinable power that this great filmmaker has that makes this story fulfilling ; even if , we are never quite sure if we are fulfilled by what we saw . but one thing is certain , you can't put this iconoclastic filmmaker in a box and label him . i wouldn't miss this one . as entertaining a film as crouching tiger . . . was , it didn't have this film's depth and poignancy . 
the film's theme is about how women are made to suffer in iran because of its harsh islamic laws against them , which makes all of their lives placed in the same never ending circle of repression . which is why the film has no main protagonist ; the cast , except for fereshteh sadr orafai and fatemeh naghavi , are all nonprofessionals . jafar panahi ( white balloon/the mirror ) , a disciple of abbas kiarostami , has created a devastatingly restrained powerhouse of a political film . a winner of the golden lion at the venice film festival , even though it has been banned in iran except for a one-time screening to a small student audience . a woman's life is shown to be not as worthy as a man's in modern iran , as the story of one woman is carried on as the story of another woman's . the enemy obviously isn't the iranian people , but an intolerant government that cannot bend and forces its stupid rules down a subjected peoples' throats . this film conveys these dark feelings through a story without much of a plot or dialogue , yet brilliantly establishes the yearnings for freedom that these women have . it's much like those warner brother films of the 1930s with jimmy cagney thumbing his nose at the high brows . panafi has taken us into the psyche of the oppressive regime and without saying what's right or wrong , allows us instead to see for ourselves the everyday street life of modern iran . it's a country far from freedom , yet its filmmakers can still make a film that is unpredictable and forthright . this is something that's rarely accomplished in uncensored hollywood whose commercial ventures are mostly formulaic crowd pleaser films . these are amazing restrictions placed on them and ones that panafi allows us to see in an exciting and unforgettable way . it's a moody , realistic tale about iran that the news media can't seem to cover with a reasonable verisimilitude as well as this very daring effort does . it succeeds in showing us as much as one can in today's iran about its long laundry list of injustices . this is one film that cannot easily be forgotten , even as we lose sight of the different women we have seen . all the performances were natural and easily fit into the story . the facial expressions of both orfani and mamizade caught my attention : orfani's had that caring , intense look of the italian actress anna magnani ; while mamizade's expression changed from curiosity to vulnerability .
