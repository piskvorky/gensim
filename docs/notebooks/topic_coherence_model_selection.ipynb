    "## Evaluation Using Coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get to the heart of this notebook. In this section, we'll evaluate each of our LDA models using topic coherence. Coherence is a measure of how interpretable the topics are to humans. It is based on the representation of topics as the top-N most probable words for a particular topic. More specifically, given the topic-term matrix for LDA, we sort each topic from highest to lowest term weights and then select the first N terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coherence essentially measures how similar these words are to each other. There are various methods for doing this, most of which have been explored in the paper [\"Exploring the Space of Topic Coherence Measures\"](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/WSDM_Topic_Evaluation/public.pdf). The authors performed a comparative analysis of various methods, correlating them to human judgements. The method named \"c_v\" coherence was found to be the most highly correlated. This and several of the other methods have been implemented in `gensim.models.CoherenceModel`. We will use this to perform our evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"c_v\" coherence method makes an expensive pass over the corpus, accumulating term occurrence and co-occurrence counts. It only accumulates counts for the terms in the lists of top-N terms for each topic. In order to ensure we only need to make one pass, we'll construct a \"super topic\" from the top-N lists of each of the models. This will consist of a single topic with all the relevant terms from all the models. We choose 20 as N."

    "### Results so Far\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this notebook, we have used `gensim`'s `CoherenceModel` to perform model selection over the number of topics for LDA. We found that for the 20 Newsgroups corpus, 30 topics is best, followed by 20. We showcased the ability of the coherence pipeline to evaluate individual aggregated model coherence (Note that the individual topic coherence is also computed by `cm.compare_models`). We also demonstrated how to avoid repeated passes over the corpus, estimating the term similarity probabilities for all relevant terms just once. Topic coherence is a powerful alternative to evaluation using perplexity on a held-out document set. It is appropriate to use whenever the objective of the topic modeling is to present the topics as top-N lists for human consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that coherence calculations are generally much more accurate when a larger reference corpus is used to estimate the probabilities. In this case, we used the same corpus as for our modeling, which is relatively small at only 20,000 documents. A better reference corpus is the full Wikipedia corpus. The motivated explorer of this notebook is encouraged to download that corpus (see [Experiments on the English Wikipedia](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/wiki.html)) and use it for probability estimation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The \"c_v\" coherence method drags a sliding window across all documents in the corpus to accumulate co-occurrence statistics. Similarity is calculated using normalized pointwise mutual information (PMI) values estimated from these statistics. More specifically, each word is represented by a vector of its NPMI with every other word in its top-N topic list. These vectors are then used to compute (cosine) similarity between words. The restriction to the other words in the top-N list was found to produce better results than using the entire vocabulary and other methods of reducing the vocabulary (see section 3.2.2 of http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-0102).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that a reduced space is superior for these metrics indicates there is noise getting in the way. The \"c_v\" method can be seen as constructing an NPMI matrix between words. The vector of NPMI values for a particular word can then be looked up by indexing the row or column corresponding to that word's `Dictionary` ID. The reduction to the \"topic word space\" can then be achieved by using a mask to select out the top-N topic words. If we are constructing an NPMI matrix between words, then discarding some elements to reduce noise, why not factorize the matrix instead? Dimensionality reduction techniques such as SVD do a great job of reducing noise along with dimensionality, while also providing a compressed representation to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Recent work](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5477-neural-word-embedding-as-implicit-matrix-factorization) has shown that Word2Vec (trained with Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS)) is actually implicitly factorizing a PMI matrix shifted by a positive constant. [A subsequent paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2914720) compared Word2Vec to a few different PMI-based metrics and showed that it found coherence values that correlated more strongly with human judgements."
