    "In this tutorial, I will explain how to visualize Doc2Vec Embeddings aka [Paragraph Vectors]() via TensorBoard. It is a data visualization framework for visualizing and inspecting the TensorFlow runs and graphs. We will use a built-in Tensorboard visualizer called *Embedding Projector* in this tutorial. It lets you interactively visualize and analyze high-dimensional data like embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, a transformed MovieLens dataset<sup>[1]</sup> was used from this [repository](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/movie-plots-by-genre) and the movie titles were added afterwards. You can download the prepared csv from [here](https://github.com/parulsethi/DocViz/blob/master/movie_plots.csv). The input documents for training are the synopsis of movies, on which Doc2Vec model is trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "The visualizations will be a scatterplot as seen in the above image, where each datapoint is labelled by the movie title and colored by it's corresponding genre. You can also visit this [Projector link](http://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parulsethi/DocViz/master/movie_plot_config.json) which is configured with my embeddings for the above mentioned dataset.

So that we basically end up with a new 2d or 3d embedding which tries to preserve information from the original multi-dimensional embedding. As these vectors are reduced to a much smaller dimension, the exact cosine/euclidean distances between them are not preserved, but rather relative, and hence as you‚Äôll see below the nearest similarity results may change.\n",

    "- **Principal Component Analysis**: PCA aims at exploring the global structure in data, and could end up losing the local similarities between neighbours. It maximizes the total variance in the lower dimensional subspace and hence, often preserves the larger pairwise distances better than the smaller ones. See an intuition behind it in this nicely explained [answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/176672/what-is-meant-by-pca-preserving-only-large-pairwise-distances) on stackexchange.\n",

It is useful for exploring local neighborhoods and finding local clusters. But the global trends are not represented accurately and the separation between different groups is often not preserved (see the t-sne plots of our data below which testify the same).\n",

It is a useful tool for visualizing different types of data for example, word embeddings, document embeddings or the gene expressions and biological sequences. It just needs an input of 2D tensors and then you can explore your data using provided algorithms. You can also perform nearest neighbours search to find most similar data points to your query point.\n",
