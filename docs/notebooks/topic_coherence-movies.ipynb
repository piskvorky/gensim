    "__Introduction__: For the validation of any model adapted from a paper, it is of utmost importance that the results of benchmark testing on the datasets listed in the paper match between the actual implementation (palmetto) and gensim. This coherence pipeline has been implemented from the work done by Roeder et al. The paper can be found [here](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/WSDM_Topic_Evaluation/public.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Approach__ :\n",
    "1. In this notebook, we'll use the Movies dataset mentioned in the paper. This dataset along with the topics on which the coherence is calculated and the gold (human) ratings on these topics can be found [here](http://139.18.2.164/mroeder/palmetto/datasets/).\n",
    "2. We will then calculate the coherence on these topics using the pipeline implemented in gensim.\n",
    "3. Once we have all our coherence values on these topics we will calculate the correlation with the human ratings using pearson's r.\n",
    "4. We will compare this final correlation value with the values listed in the paper and see if the pipeline is working as expected."
