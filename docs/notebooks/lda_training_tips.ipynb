    "# Pre-processing and training LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to pre-process text data, and how to train the LDA model on that data. This tutorial will **not** explain you the LDA model, how inference is made in the LDA model, and it will not necessarily teach you how to use Gensim's implementation. There are plenty of resources for all of those things, but what is somewhat lacking is a hands-on tutorial that helps you train an LDA model with good results... so here is my contribution towards that.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used a corpus of NIPS papers in this tutorial, but if you're following this tutorial just to learn about LDA I encourage you to consider picking a corpus on a subject that you are familiar with. Qualitatively evaluating the output of an LDA model is challenging and can require you to understand the subject matter of your corpus (depending on your goal with the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also encourage you to consider each step when applying the model to your data, instead of just blindly applying my solution. The different steps will depend on your data and possibly your goal with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will go through pre-processing the data and training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This tutorial uses the nltk library, although you can replace it with something else if you want. Python 3 is used, although Python 2.7 can be used as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load data.\n",
    "* Pre-process data.\n",
    "* Transform documents to a vectorized form.\n",
    "* Train an LDA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with the LDA model or how to use it in Gensim, I suggest you read up on that before continuing with this tutorial. Basic understanding of the LDA model should suffice. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gentle introduction to the LDA model: http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using some papers from the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) conference. NIPS is a machine learning conference so the subject matter should be well suited for most of the target audience of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the data from Sam Roweis' website (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the corpus contains 1740 documents, and not particularly long ones. So keep in mind that this tutorial is not geared towards efficiency, and be careful before applying the code to a large dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are ready to train the LDA model. We will first discuss how to set some of the training parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the elephant in the room: how many topics do I need? There is really no easy answer for this, it will depend on both your data and your application. I have used 10 topics here because I wanted to have a few topics that I could interpret and \"label\", and because that turned out to give me reasonably good results. You might not need to interpret all your topics, so you could use a large number of topics, for example 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chunksize` controls how many documents are processed at a time in the training algorithm. Increasing chunksize will speed up training, at least as long as the chunk of documents easily fit into memory. I've set `chunksize = 2000`, which is more than the amount of documents, so I process all the data in one go. Chunksize can however influence the quality of the model, as discussed in Hoffman and co-authors [2], but the difference was not substantial in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "`passes` controls how often we train the model on the entire corpus. Another word for passes might be \"epochs\". `iterations` is somewhat technical, but essentially it controls how often we repeat a particular loop over each document. It is important to set the number of \"passes\" and \"iterations\" high enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest the following way to choose iterations and passes. First, enable logging (as described in many Gensim tutorials), and set `eval_every = 1` in `LdaModel`. When training the model look for a line in the log that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2016-06-21 15:40:06,753 - gensim.models.ldamodel - DEBUG - 68/1566 documents converged within 400 iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set `passes = 20` you will see this line 20 times. Make sure that by the final passes, most of the documents have converged. So you want to choose both passes and iterations to be high enough for this to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set `alpha = 'auto'` and `eta = 'auto'`. Again this is somewhat technical, but essentially we are automatically learning two parameters in the model that we usually would have to specify explicitly."
