    "# News classification with topic models in gensim\n",
    "News article classification is a task which is performed on a huge scale by news agencies all over the world. We will be looking into how topic modeling can be used to accurately classify news articles into different categories such as sports, technology, politics etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim in this tutorial is to come up with some topic model which can come up with topics that can easily be interpreted by us. Such a topic model can be used to discover hidden structure in the corpus and can also be used to determine the membership of a news article into one of the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be using the Lee corpus which is a shortened version of the [Lee Background Corpus](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~mdlee/lee_pincombe_welsh_document.PDF). The shortened version consists of 300 documents selected from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's news mail service. It consists of texts of headline stories from around the year 2000-2001.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accompanying slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/dsquareindia/pycon-delhi-lightening).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "In this tutorial we look at how different topic models can be easily created using [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/).\n",
    "Following are the dependencies for this tutorial:\n",
    "    - Gensim Version >=0.13.1 would be preferred since we will be using topic coherence metrics extensively here.\n",
    "    - matplotlib\n",
    "    - nltk.stopwords and nltk.wordnet\n",
    "    - pyLDAVis\n",
    "We will be playing around with 4 different topic models here:\n",
    "    - LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)\n",
    "    - HDP (Hierarchical Dirichlet Process)\n",
    "    - LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)\n",
    "    - LDA (tweaked with topic coherence to find optimal number of topics) and\n",
    "    - LDA as LSI with the help of topic coherence metrics\n",
    "First we'll fit those topic models on our existing data then we'll compare each against the other and see how they rank in terms of human interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "All can be found in gensim and can be easily used in a plug-and-play fashion. We will tinker with the LDA model using the newly added topic coherence metrics in gensim based on [this](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/WSDM_Topic_Evaluation/public.pdf) paper by Roeder et al and see how the resulting topic model compares with the exsisting ones."

      "['Hundreds of people have been forced to vacate their homes in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales as strong winds today pushed a huge bushfire towards the town of Hill Top. A new blaze near Goulburn, south-west of Sydney, has forced the closure of the Hume Highway. At about 4:00pm AEDT, a marked deterioration in the weather as a storm cell moved east across the Blue Mountains forced authorities to make a decision to evacuate people from homes in outlying streets at Hill Top in the New South Wales southern highlands. An estimated 500 residents have left their homes for nearby Mittagong. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service says the weather conditions which caused the fire to burn in a finger formation have now eased and about 60 fire units in and around Hill Top are optimistic of defending all properties. As more than 100 blazes burn on New Year\\'s Eve in New South Wales, fire crews have been called to new fire at Gunning, south of Goulburn. While few details are available at this stage, fire authorities says it has closed the Hume Highway in both directions. Meanwhile, a new fire in Sydney\\'s west is no longer threatening properties in the Cranebrook area. Rain has fallen in some parts of the Illawarra, Sydney, the Hunter Valley and the north coast. But the Bureau of Meteorology\\'s Claire Richards says the rain has done little to ease any of the hundred fires still burning across the state. \"The falls have been quite isolated in those areas and generally the falls have been less than about five millimetres,\" she said. \"In some places really not significant at all, less than a millimetre, so there hasn\\'t been much relief as far as rain is concerned. \"In fact, they\\'ve probably hampered the efforts of the firefighters more because of the wind gusts that are associated with those thunderstorms.\" \\n']\n",
      "[\"Indian security forces have shot dead eight suspected militants in a night-long encounter in southern Kashmir. The shootout took place at Dora village some 50 kilometers south of the Kashmiri summer capital Srinagar. The deaths came as Pakistani police arrested more than two dozen militants from extremist groups accused of staging an attack on India's parliament. India has accused Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad of carrying out the attack on December 13 at the behest of Pakistani military intelligence. Military tensions have soared since the raid, with both sides massing troops along their border and trading tit-for-tat diplomatic sanctions. Yesterday, Pakistan announced it had arrested Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed. Police in Karachi say it is likely more raids will be launched against the two groups as well as other militant organisations accused of targetting India. Military tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated to a level not seen since their 1971 war. \\n\"]\n",
      "['The national road toll for the Christmas-New Year holiday period stands at 45, eight fewer than for the same time last year. 20 people have died on New South Wales roads, with eight fatalities in both Queensland and Victoria.

      "[\"Argentina's political and economic crisis has deepened with the resignation of its interim President who took office just a week ago. Aldolfo Rodregiuez Saa told a stunned nation that he could not rescue Argentina because key fellow Peronists would not support his default on massive foreign debt repayment or his plan for a new currency. It was only a week ago that he was promising a million new jobs to end four years of recession, days after his predecessor resigned following a series of failed rescue packages. After announcing that the senate leader, Ramon Puerta, would assume the presidency until congress appoints a new caretaker president, the government said he too had quit and another senior lawmaker would act in the role. Fresh elections are not scheduled until March leaving whoever assumes the presidency with the daunting task of tackling Argentina's worst crisis in 12 years, but this time, isolated by international lending agencies. \\n\"]\n",
      "['Six midwives have been suspended at Wollongong Hospital, south of Sydney, for inappropriate use of nitrous oxide during work hours, on some occasions while women were in labour. The Illawarra Area Health Service says that following an investigation of unprofessional conduct, a further four midwives have been relocated to other areas within the hospital. The service\\'s chief executive officer, Tony Sherbon, says no one was put at risk, because other staff not involved in the use of nitrous oxide were able to take over caring for women in labour. \"Well we\\'re very concerned and the body of midwives to the hospital - there are over 70 midwives that work in our service - are very annoyed and angry at the inappropriate behaviour of these very senior people who should know better,\" he said. \"And that\\'s why we\\'ve take the action of suspending them and we\\'ll consider further action next week.\" \\n']\n"

    "Topic coherence in essence measures the human interpretability of a topic model. Traditionally [perplexity has been used](http://qpleple.com/perplexity-to-evaluate-topic-models/) to evaluate topic models however this does not correlate with human annotations at times. Topic coherence is another way to evaluate topic models with a much higher guarantee on human interpretability. Thus this can be used to compare different topic models among many other use-cases.
