    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply Doc2vec using gensim by recreating the results of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf\">Le and Mikolov 2014</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words Model\n",
    "Previous state-of-the-art document representations were based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\">bag-of-words model</a>, which represent input documents as a fixed-length vector. For example, borrowing from the Wikipedia article, the two documents  \n",
    "(1) `John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.`  \n",
    "(2) `John also likes to watch football games.`  \n",
    "are used to construct a length 10 list of words  \n",
    "`[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\"]`  \n",
    "so then we can represent the two documents as fixed length vectors whose elements are the frequencies of the corresponding words in our list  \n",
    "(1) `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`  \n",
    "(2) `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`  \n",
    "Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective but still lose information about word order. Bag of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\">n-grams</a> models consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as fixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data sparsity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2vec Model\n",
    "Word2vec is a more recent model that embeds words in a high-dimensional vector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of word vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar meanings based on context, and word vectors distant to each other have differing meanings. For example, `strong` and `powerful` would be close together and `strong` and `Paris` would be relatively far. There are two versions of this model based on skip-grams and continuous bag of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2vec - Skip-gram Model\n",
    "The skip-gram <a href=\"http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/\">word2vec</a> model, for example, takes in pairs (word1, word2) generated by moving a window across text data, and trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on the fake task of given an input word, giving us a predicted probability distribution of nearby words to the input. The hidden-to-output weights in the neural network give us the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer has 300 neurons, this network will give us 300-dimensional word embeddings. We use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot\">one-hot</a> encoding for the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2vec - Continuous-bag-of-words Model\n",
    "Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec is very similar to the skip-gram model. It is also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. The fake task is based on the input context words in a window around a center word, predict the center word. Again, the hidden-to-output weights give us the word embeddings and we use one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraph Vector\n",
    "Le and Mikolov 2014 introduces the <i>Paragraph Vector</i>, which outperforms more naïve representations of documents such as averaging the Word2vec word vectors of a document. The idea is straightforward: we act as if a paragraph (or document) is just another vector like a word vector, but we will call it a paragraph vector. We determine the embedding of the paragraph in vector space in the same way as words. Our paragraph vector model considers local word order like bag of n-grams, but gives us a denser representation in vector space compared to a sparse, high-dimensional representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector model analogous to Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec. The paragraph vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the fake task of inferring a center word based on context words and a context paragraph. A paragraph is a context for all words in the paragraph, and a word in a paragraph can have that paragraph as a context. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector model analogous to Skip-gram Word2vec. The paragraph vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the fake task of predicting a probability distribution of words in a paragraph given a randomly-sampled word from the paragraph.\n",
