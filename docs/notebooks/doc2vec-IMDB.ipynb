      "MEDIAN (6999, 0.4129640758037567): «okay , the recent history of star trek has not been good . the next generation faded in its last few seasons , ds9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before , and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise . so , when they announced a new star trek series , i did not have high expectations . and , the first episode , broken bow , did have some problems . but , overall it was solid trek material and a good romp . i'll get the nits out of the way first . the opening theme is dull and i don't look forward to sitting through it regularly , but that's what remotes are for . what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room . they need to cut that nonsense out . but , the plot was strong and moved along well . the characters , though still new , seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect . the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before , with a slightly ominous theme . i particularly liked the linguist , who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death , but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears . they seemed to stay true to trek lore , something that has been a significant problem in past series , though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields , the instant invention of technology that can fix anything , and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories . anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show up ? all in all , the series has enormous potential . they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes . we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series . how did the klingons go from just insulting to war ? how did we meet the romulans ? how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge . why is the prime directive so important ? if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes , this will be an interesting series . my favorite line : zephram cochran saying \" where no man has gone before \" ( not \" no one \" )»\n",

      "LEAST (16617, 0.015464222989976406): «i saw this movie during a tolkien-themed interim class during my sophomore year of college . i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing , but they weren't within constant eyesight . let's get it out of the way : the peter jackson 'lord of the rings' films do owe something to the bakshi film . in jackson's version of the fellowship of the ring , for instance , the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi's film , shot by shot . you could call this plagiarism or homage , depending on your agenda . i'm sure the similarities don't stop there . i'm not going to do any research to find out what they are , because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film . i'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around . this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor , and many , many people died in the accident . i've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- if i've left out anything else that offended me it's because i'm completely overwhelmed , confronted with a wealth of failure ( and , at high points , mediocrity ) . *due to heavy use of rotoscoping , gandalf is no longer a gentle , wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom ( whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film ) . *saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman' during the film , without explanation . he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason . *sam is flat out hideous . the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying . yes , hobbits are small like children , but they are not children . *merry and pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation . the film is filled with sloppy editing like this . *frodo , sam , pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road . one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back--which was not visible before--and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into \" la-la-la \" s . awful . *aragorn , apparently , is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic ( no pants ) , complete with huge , square pilgrim belt buckle . he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie--oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass . *the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil . they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace . this is disturbing to be sure , but not frightening . *the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen ( in which they stare at frodo , who is on the other side on horseback ) goes on forever , during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and . . . do nothing else . the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound . it turns out to be more plodding than anything else . *gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf . he's a dwarf . there is simply no excuse for that . he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome . it's a crude but accurate description . *boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode . he looks ridiculous . *despite the similarity to tolkien's illustration , the balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film . it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers , and it's barely taller than gandalf . \" purists \" may prefer this balrog , but i'll take jackson's version any day . *the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing . almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments . i'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in jackson's film , but they are supposed to be fighting . *treebeard makes a very short appearance , and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all . watch the film , you'll see what i mean . alright , now for the good parts of the film . *some of the voice acting is pretty good . it isn't that aragorn sounds bad , he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant . *galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal ; like tom bombadil , she seems immune to the ring's powers of temptation , and her voice actress isn't horrible either . *boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in jackson's portrayal of the same scene , but it's still appropriately dramatic ( and more true to his death in the book , though i don't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did ) . *as my professor pointed out ( between whispered threats ) , the orcs ( mainly at helm's deep , if i'm correct ) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers , a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted . *while this isn't really a positive point about the film , bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie , or so i've been told--the project was on a tight budget , and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups ( who i'm sure hadn't read the books ) . let me be clear : i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude . i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product . overall , i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs , unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters , places and events . i'm sure somebody , somewhere , will pick a copy of this up in confusion ; if you do , keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it .»\n",
