    "## Core Concepts and Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very high-level, `gensim` is a tool for discovering the semantic structure of documents by examining the patterns of words (or higher-level structures such as entire sentences or documents). `gensim` accomplishes this by taking a *corpus*, a collection of text documents, and producing a *vector* representation of the text in the corpus. The vector representation can then be used to train a *model*, which is an algorithms to create different representations of the data, which are usually more semantic. These three concepts are key to understanding how `gensim` works so let's take a moment to explain what each of them means. At the same time, we'll work through a simple example that illustrates each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corpus\n",
    "\n",


    "A *corpus* is a collection of digital documents. This collection is the input to `gensim` from which it will infer the structure of the documents, their topics, etc. The latent structure inferred from the corpus can later be used to assign topics to new documents which were not present in the training corpus. For this reason, we also refer to this collection as the *training corpus*. No human intervention (such as tagging the documents by hand) is required - the topic classification is [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning.html).\n",


    "\n",
    "For our corpus, we'll use a list of 9 strings, each consisting of only a single sentence."

    "After collecting our corpus, there are typically a number of preprocessing steps we want to undertake. We'll keep it simple and just remove some commonly used English words (such as 'the') and words that occur only once in the corpus. In the process of doing so, we'll [tokenise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(lexical_analysis)) our data. Tokenization breaks up the documents into words (in this case using space as a delimiter)."

    "To infer the latent structure in our corpus we need a way to represent documents that we can manipulate mathematically. One approach is to represent each document as a vector. There are various approaches for creating a vector representation of a document but a simple example is the *bag-of-words model*. Under the bag-of-words model each document is represented by a vector containing the frequency counts of each word in the dictionary. For example, given a dictionary containing the words `['coffee', 'milk', 'sugar', 'spoon']` a document consisting of the string `\"coffee milk coffee\"` could be represented by the vector `[2, 1, 0, 0]` where the entries of the vector are (in order) the occurrences of \"coffee\", \"milk\", \"sugar\" and \"spoon\" in the document. The length of the vector is the number of entries in the dictionary. One of the main properties of the bag-of-words model is that it completely ignores the order of the tokens in the document that is encoded, which is where the name bag-of-words comes from.\n",
