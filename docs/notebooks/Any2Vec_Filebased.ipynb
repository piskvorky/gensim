    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original implementation of Word2Vec training in Gensim is already super fast (covered in [this blog series](https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-in-python-part-two-optimizing/), see also [benchmarks against other implementations in Tensorflow, DL4J, and C](https://rare-technologies.com/machine-learning-hardware-benchmarks/)) and flexible, allowing you to train on arbitrary Python streams. We had to jump through [some serious hoops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4TlwZzTfU) to make it so, avoiding the Global Interpreter Lock (the dreaded GIL, the main bottleneck for any serious high performance computation in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result worked great for modest machines (< 8 cores), but for higher-end servers, the GIL reared its ugly head again. Simply managing the input stream iterators and worker queues, which has to be done in Python holding the GIL, was becoming the bottleneck. Simply put, the Python implementation didn't scale linearly with cores, as the original C implementation by Tomáš Mikolov did."

    "We decided to change that. After [much](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/pull/2127) [experimentation](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/pull/2048#issuecomment-401494412) and [benchmarking](https://persiyanov.github.io/jekyll/update/2018/05/28/gsoc-first-weeks.html), including some pretty [hardcore outlandish ideas](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/pull/2127#issuecomment-405937741), we figured there's no way around the GIL limitations—not at the level of fine-tuned performance needed here. Remember, we're talking >500k words (training instances) per second, using highly optimized C code. Way past the naive \"vectorize with NumPy arrays\" territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we decided to introduce a new code path, which has *less flexibility* in favour of *more performance*. We call this code path **`file-based training`**, and it's realized by passing a new `corpus_file` parameter to training. The existing `sentences` parameter (queue-based training) is still available, and you can continue using without any change: there's **full backward compatibility**."

    "When you specify `corpus_file`, the model will read and process different portions of the file with different workers. The entire bulk of work is done outside of GIL, using no Python structures at all. The workers update the same weight matrix, but otherwise there's no communication, each worker munches on its data portion completely independently. This is the same approach the original C tool uses. \n",
