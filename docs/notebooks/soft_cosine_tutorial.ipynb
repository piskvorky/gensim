    "# Finding similar documents with Word2Vec and Soft Cosine Measure \n",
    "\n",
    "Soft Cosine Measure (SCM) [1, 3] is a promising new tool in machine learning that allows us to submit a query and return the most relevant documents. In **part 1**, we will show how you can compute SCM between two documents using the `inner_product` method. In **part 2**, we will use `SoftCosineSimilarity` to retrieve documents most similar to a query and compare the performance against other similarity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, however, we go through the basics of what Soft Cosine Measure is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Soft Cosine Measure basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft Cosine Measure (SCM) is a method that allows us to assess the similarity between two documents in a meaningful way, even when they have no words in common. It uses a measure of similarity between words, which can be derived [2] using [word2vec][] [4] vector embeddings of words. It has been shown to outperform many of the state-of-the-art methods in the semantic text similarity task in the context of community question answering [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "[word2vec]: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html\n",
    "\n",
    "SCM is illustrated below for two very similar sentences. The sentences have no words in common, but by modeling synonymy, SCM is able to accurately measure the similarity between the two sentences. The method also uses the bag-of-words vector representation of the documents (simply put, the word's frequencies in the documents). The intution behind the method is that we compute standard cosine similarity assuming that the document vectors are expressed in a non-orthogonal basis, where the angle between two basis vectors is derived from the angle between the word2vec embeddings of the corresponding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Soft Cosine Measure](soft_cosine_tutorial.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method was perhaps first introduced in the article “Soft Measure and Soft Cosine Measure: Measure of Features in Vector Space Model” by Grigori Sidorov, Alexander Gelbukh, Helena Gomez-Adorno, and David Pinto ([link to PDF](http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/cys/v18n3/v18n3a7.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Gensim's SCM functionality, which consists of the `inner_product` method for one-off computation, and the `SoftCosineSimilarity` class for corpus-based similarity queries.\n",

    "## Running this notebook\n",
    "You can download this [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/), and run it on your own computer, provided you have installed the `gensim`, `jupyter`, `sklearn`, `POT`, and `wmd` Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook was run on an Ubuntu machine with an Intel core i7-6700HQ CPU 3.10GHz (4 cores) and 16 GB memory. Assuming all resources required by the notebook have already been downloaded, running the entire notebook on this machine takes about 30 minutes."
