    "This module automatically summarizes the given text, by extracting one or more important sentences from the text. In a similar way, it can also extract keywords. This tutorial will teach you to use this summarization module via some examples. First, we will try a small example, then we will try two larger ones, and then we will review the performance of the summarizer in terms of speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summarizer is based on the \"TextRank\" algorithm, from an [article](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/%7Emihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) by Mihalcea et al. This algorithm was later improved upon by Barrios et al. in another [article](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/summanlp/docs/master/articulo/articulo-en.pdf), by introducing something called a \"BM25 ranking function\". \n",
