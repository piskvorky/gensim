    "\n",
    "This module automatically summarizes the given text, by extracting one or more important sentences from the text. In a similar way, it can also extract keywords. This tutorial will teach you to use this summarization module via some examples. First, we will try a small example, then we will try two larger ones, and then we will review the performance of the summarizer in terms of speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summarizer is based on the \"TextRank\" algorithm, from an [article](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/%7Emihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) by Mihalcea et al. This algorithm was later improved upon by Barrios et al. in another [article](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/summanlp/docs/master/articulo/articulo-en.pdf), by introducing something called a \"BM25 ranking function\". \n",

    "The running time is not only dependent on the size of the dataset. For example, summarizing \"The Matrix\" synopsis (about 36,000 characters) takes about 3.1 seconds, while summarizing 35,000 characters of this book takes about 8.5 seconds. So the former is <i>more than twice as fast</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for this difference in running times is the data structure that is used. The algorithm represents the data using a graph, where vertices (nodes) are sentences, and then constructs weighted edges between the vertices that represent how the sentences relate to each other. This means that every piece of text will have a different graph, thus making the running times different. The size of this data structure is <i>quadratic in the worst case</i> (the worst case is when each vertex has an edge to every other vertex).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible reason for the difference in running times is that the problems converge at different rates, meaning that the error drops slower for some datasets than for others.\n"
