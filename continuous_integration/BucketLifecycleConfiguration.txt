JSON files can't have comments, so this file is here to explain the rules in BucketLifecycleConfiguration.json.

Our CI puts wheels in a publicly readable, privately writable S3 bucket (s3://gensim-wheels).
These wheels can be for gensim releases, in which case we fetch them and push them to PyPI when making a release.
Once the wheels are on PyPI, we don't need to keep our own copy.

These wheels can also be development wheels: we currently build wheels on every push to develop.
These can be helpful when tracking down a problem, but they can also build up quickly, consume storage space and contribute to AWS costs.

So, we delete all files in the gensim-wheels bucket every 90 days.
We rarely need to access wheels that are several months old, anyway.

If you modify the JSON configuration, then you can update it using the command:

    aws --profile smart_open s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket gensim-wheels --lifecycle-configuration file://continuous_integration/BucketLifecycleConfiguration.json
