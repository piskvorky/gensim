TestFixtures
============

TestFixtures is a collection of helpers and mock objects that are
useful when writing unit tests or doc tests.

If you're wondering why "yet another mock object library", testing is
often described as an art form and as such some styles of library will
suit some people while others will suit other styles. This library
contains common test fixtures the author found himself
repeating from package to package and so decided to extract them into
their own library and give them some tests of their own!

The areas of testing this package can help with are listed below:

**Comparing objects and sequences**

Better feedback when the results aren't as you expected along with
support for comparison of objects that don't normally support
comparison. 

**Mocking out objects and methods**

Easy to use ways of stubbing out objects, classes or individual
methods for both doc tests and unit tests. Special helpers are
provided for testing with dates and times.

**Testing logging**

Helpers for capturing logging output in both doc tests and
unit tests. 

**Testing stream output**

Helpers for capturing stream output, such as that from print
statements, and making assertion about it. 

**Testing with files and directories**

Support for creating and checking files and directories in sandboxes
for both doc tests and unit tests.

**Testing exceptions and warnings**

Easy to use ways of checking that a certain exception is raised,
or a warning is issued, even down the to the parameters provided.

**Testing subprocesses**

A handy mock for testing code that uses subprocesses.

**Testing when using django**

Helpers for comparing instances of django models.

**Testing when using zope.component**

An easy to use sterile component registry.
