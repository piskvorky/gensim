Objects for dealing with polynomials.

This module provides a number of objects (mostly functions) useful for
dealing with polynomials, including a `Polynomial` class that
encapsulates the usual arithmetic operations.  (General information

    Generate a monic polynomial with given roots.

    Return the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.  If a zero has
    multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times. For instance,
    if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of multiplicity 2,
    then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The roots can appear
    in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... +  x^n

    The coefficient of the last term is 1 for monic polynomials in this
    form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of the polynomial's coefficients If all the roots are
        real, then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.  (see

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.  Why
    is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`. Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... + c_n * x^n

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with

    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D polynomials
    of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

def polyfit(x, y, deg, rcond=None, full=False, w=None):
    """
    Least-squares fit of a polynomial to data.

    Return the coefficients of a polynomial of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... + c_n * x^n,

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (`M`,)
        x-coordinates of the `M` sample (data) points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (`M`,) or (`M`, `K`)
        y-coordinates of the sample points.  Several sets of sample points
        sharing the same x-coordinates can be (independently) fit with one
        call to `polyfit` by passing in for `y` a 2-D array that contains
        one data set per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit.  Singular values smaller
        than `rcond`, relative to the largest singular value, will be
        ignored.  The default value is ``len(x)*eps``, where `eps` is the
        relative precision of the platform's float type, about 2e-16 in
        most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining the nature of the return value.  When ``False``
        (the default) just the coefficients are returned; when ``True``,
        diagnostic information from the singular value decomposition (used
        to solve the fit's matrix equation) is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (`deg` + 1,) or (`deg` + 1, `K`)
        Polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.  If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients in column `k` of `coef` represent the polynomial
        fit to the data in `y`'s `k`-th column.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Raises
    ------
    RankWarning
        Raised if the matrix in the least-squares fit is rank deficient.
        The warning is only raised if `full` == False.  The warnings can
        be turned off by:

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline : Computes spline fits.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the polynomial `p` that minimizes
    the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math :: E = \\sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up the (typically) over-determined matrix equation:

    .. math :: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected (and `full` == ``False``), a `RankWarning` will be raised.
    This means that the coefficient values may be poorly determined.
    Fitting to a lower order polynomial will usually get rid of the warning
    (but may not be what you want, of course; if you have independent
    reason(s) for choosing the degree which isn't working, you may have to:
    a) reconsider those reasons, and/or b) reconsider the quality of your
    data).  The `rcond` parameter can also be set to a value smaller than
    its default, but the resulting fit may be spurious and have large
    contributions from roundoff error.

    Polynomial fits using double precision tend to "fail" at about
    (polynomial) degree 20. Fits using Chebyshev or Legendre series are
    generally better conditioned, but much can still depend on the
    distribution of the sample points and the smoothness of the data.  If
    the quality of the fit is inadequate, splines may be a good
    alternative.

    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the power series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.
