    Notes
    -----
    FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
    calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
    the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.

    The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
    the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

    Compute the one-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the one-dimensional *n*-point
    discrete Fourier transform computed by `fft`.  In other words,
    ``ifft(fft(a)) == a`` to within numerical accuracy.
    For a general description of the algorithm and definitions,
    see `numpy.fft`.

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `fft`,
    i.e.,

    * ``a[0]`` should contain the zero frequency term,
    * ``a[1:n//2]`` should contain the positive-frequency terms,
    * ``a[n//2 + 1:]`` should contain the negative-frequency terms, in
      increasing order starting from the most negative frequency.

    For an even number of input points, ``A[n//2]`` represents the sum of
    the values at the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies, as the two
    are aliased together. See `numpy.fft` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.

        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
        See notes about padding issues.
    axis : int, optional

        axis is used.

    Notes
    -----
    If the input parameter `n` is larger than the size of the input, the input
    is padded by appending zeros at the end.  Even though this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If a different padding is
    desired, it must be performed before calling `ifft`.

        If `n` is even, the length of the transformed axis is ``(n/2)+1``.
        If `n` is odd, the length is ``(n+1)/2``.

    ------
    IndexError

    fft : The one-dimensional FFT of general (complex) input.
    fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.
    rfftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    When the DFT is computed for purely real input, the output is
    Hermitian-symmetric, i.e. the negative frequency terms are just the complex
    conjugates of the corresponding positive-frequency terms, and the
    negative-frequency terms are therefore redundant.  This function does not
    compute the negative frequency terms, and the length of the transformed
    axis of the output is therefore ``n//2 + 1``.

    When ``A = rfft(a)`` and fs is the sampling frequency, ``A[0]`` contains
    the zero-frequency term 0*fs, which is real due to Hermitian symmetry.

    If `n` is even, ``A[-1]`` contains the term representing both positive
    and negative Nyquist frequency (+fs/2 and -fs/2), and must also be purely
    real. If `n` is odd, there is no term at fs/2; ``A[-1]`` contains
    the largest positive frequency (fs/2*(n-1)/n), and is complex in the
    general case.

    If the input `a` contains an imaginary part, it is silently discarded.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fft.fft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j,  0.+1.j])
    >>> np.fft.rfft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j])

    Notice how the final element of the `fft` output is the complex conjugate
    of the second element, for real input. For `rfft`, this symmetry is
    exploited to compute only the non-negative frequency terms.

    Notes
    -----
    Returns the real valued `n`-point inverse discrete Fourier transform
    of `a`, where `a` contains the non-negative frequency terms of a
    Hermitian-symmetric sequence. `n` is the length of the result, not the
    input.

    If you specify an `n` such that `a` must be zero-padded or truncated, the
    extra/removed values will be added/removed at high frequencies. One can
    thus resample a series to `m` points via Fourier interpolation by:
    ``a_resamp = irfft(rfft(a), m)``.

    Notes
    -----
    `hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
    opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
    which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd:

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2) == a``, within roundoff error,
    * odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1) == a``, within roundoff error.

         of real input.
    fft : The one-dimensional FFT, with definitions and conventions used.
    rfft : The one-dimensional FFT of real input.
    fftn : The n-dimensional FFT.
    rfft2 : The two-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    The transform for real input is performed over the last transformation
    axis, as by `rfft`, then the transform over the remaining axes is
    performed as by `fftn`.  The order of the output is as for `rfft` for the
    final transformation axis, and as for `fftn` for the remaining
    transformation axes.

    See `fft` for details, definitions and conventions used.

def irfftn(a, s=None, axes=None, norm=None):
    """
    Compute the inverse of the N-dimensional FFT of real input.

    This function computes the inverse of the N-dimensional discrete
    Fourier Transform for real input over any number of axes in an
    M-dimensional array by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In
    other words, ``irfftn(rfftn(a), a.shape) == a`` to within numerical
    accuracy. (The ``a.shape`` is necessary like ``len(a)`` is for `irfft`,
    and for the same reason.)

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `rfftn`,
    i.e. as for `irfft` for the final transformation axis, and as for `ifftn`
    along all the other axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.). `s` is also the
        number of input points used along this axis, except for the last axis,
        where ``s[-1]//2+1`` points of the input are used.
        Along any axis, if the shape indicated by `s` is smaller than that of
        the input, the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded
        with zeros. If `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the
        axes specified by `axes` is used.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        `len(s)` axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
        Repeated indices in `axes` means that the inverse transform over that
        axis is performed multiple times.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` or `a`,
        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of each transformed axis is as given by the corresponding
        element of `s`, or the length of the input in every axis except for the
        last one if `s` is not given.  In the final transformed axis the length
        of the output when `s` is not given is ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the
        length of the final transformed axis of the input.  To get an odd
        number of output points in the final axis, `s` must be specified.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

            of which `ifftn` is the inverse.
