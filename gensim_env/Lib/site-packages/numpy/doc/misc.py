IEEE 754 Floating Point Special Values
--------------------------------------

Special values defined in numpy: nan, inf,

NaNs can be used as a poor-man's mask (if you don't care what the
original value was)

Note: cannot use equality to test NaNs. E.g.: ::

 >>> myarr = np.array([1., 0., np.nan, 3.])
 >>> np.nonzero(myarr == np.nan)
 (array([], dtype=int64),)
 >>> np.nan == np.nan  # is always False! Use special numpy functions instead.
 False
 >>> myarr[myarr == np.nan] = 0. # doesn't work
 >>> myarr
 array([  1.,   0.,  NaN,   3.])
 >>> myarr[np.isnan(myarr)] = 0. # use this instead find
 >>> myarr
 array([ 1.,  0.,  0.,  3.])

Other related special value functions: ::

 isinf():    True if value is inf
 isfinite(): True if not nan or inf
 nan_to_num(): Map nan to 0, inf to max float, -inf to min float

The following corresponds to the usual functions except that nans are excluded
from the results: ::

 nansum()
 nanmax()
 nanmin()
 nanargmax()
 nanargmin()

 >>> x = np.arange(10.)
 >>> x[3] = np.nan
 >>> x.sum()
 nan
 >>> np.nansum(x)
 42.0

How numpy handles numerical exceptions
--------------------------------------

The default is to ``'warn'`` for ``invalid``, ``divide``, and ``overflow``
and ``'ignore'`` for ``underflow``.  But this can be changed, and it can be
set individually for different kinds of exceptions. The different behaviors
are:

 - 'ignore' : Take no action when the exception occurs.
 - 'warn'   : Print a `RuntimeWarning` (via the Python `warnings` module).
 - 'raise'  : Raise a `FloatingPointError`.
 - 'call'   : Call a function specified using the `seterrcall` function.
 - 'print'  : Print a warning directly to ``stdout``.
 - 'log'    : Record error in a Log object specified by `seterrcall`.

These behaviors can be set for all kinds of errors or specific ones:

 - all       : apply to all numeric exceptions
 - invalid   : when NaNs are generated
 - divide    : divide by zero (for integers as well!)
 - overflow  : floating point overflows
 - underflow : floating point underflows

Note that integer divide-by-zero is handled by the same machinery.
These behaviors are set on a per-thread basis.

Examples
--------

::

 >>> oldsettings = np.seterr(all='warn')
 >>> np.zeros(5,dtype=np.float32)/0.
 invalid value encountered in divide
 >>> j = np.seterr(under='ignore')
 >>> np.array([1.e-100])**10
 >>> j = np.seterr(invalid='raise')
 >>> np.sqrt(np.array([-1.]))
 FloatingPointError: invalid value encountered in sqrt
 >>> def errorhandler(errstr, errflag):
 ...      print("saw stupid error!")
 >>> np.seterrcall(errorhandler)
 <function err_handler at 0x...>
 >>> j = np.seterr(all='call')
 >>> np.zeros(5, dtype=np.int32)/0
 FloatingPointError: invalid value encountered in divide
 saw stupid error!
 >>> j = np.seterr(**oldsettings) # restore previous
 ...                              # error-handling settings

Interfacing to C
----------------
Only a survey of the choices. Little detail on how each works.

1) Bare metal, wrap your own C-code manually.

 - Plusses:

   - Efficient
   - No dependencies on other tools

 - Minuses:

   - Lots of learning overhead:

     - need to learn basics of Python C API
     - need to learn basics of numpy C API
     - need to learn how to handle reference counting and love it.

   - Reference counting often difficult to get right.

     - getting it wrong leads to memory leaks, and worse, segfaults

   - API will change for Python 3.0!

2) Cython

 - Plusses:

   - avoid learning C API's
   - no dealing with reference counting
   - can code in pseudo python and generate C code
   - can also interface to existing C code
   - should shield you from changes to Python C api
   - has become the de-facto standard within the scientific Python community
   - fast indexing support for arrays

 - Minuses:

   - Can write code in non-standard form which may become obsolete
   - Not as flexible as manual wrapping

3) ctypes

 - Plusses:

   - part of Python standard library
   - good for interfacing to existing sharable libraries, particularly
     Windows DLLs
   - avoids API/reference counting issues
   - good numpy support: arrays have all these in their ctypes
     attribute: ::

       a.ctypes.data              a.ctypes.get_strides
       a.ctypes.data_as           a.ctypes.shape
       a.ctypes.get_as_parameter  a.ctypes.shape_as
       a.ctypes.get_data          a.ctypes.strides
       a.ctypes.get_shape         a.ctypes.strides_as

 - Minuses:

   - can't use for writing code to be turned into C extensions, only a wrapper
     tool.

4) SWIG (automatic wrapper generator)

 - Plusses:

   - around a long time
   - multiple scripting language support
   - C++ support
   - Good for wrapping large (many functions) existing C libraries

 - Minuses:

   - generates lots of code between Python and the C code
   - can cause performance problems that are nearly impossible to optimize
     out
   - interface files can be hard to write
   - doesn't necessarily avoid reference counting issues or needing to know
     API's

5) scipy.weave

 - Plusses:

   - can turn many numpy expressions into C code
   - dynamic compiling and loading of generated C code
   - can embed pure C code in Python module and have weave extract, generate
     interfaces and compile, etc.

 - Minuses:

   - Future very uncertain: it's the only part of Scipy not ported to Python 3
     and is effectively deprecated in favor of Cython.

6) Psyco

 - Plusses:

   - Turns pure python into efficient machine code through jit-like
     optimizations
   - very fast when it optimizes well

 - Minuses:

   - Only on intel (windows?)
   - Doesn't do much for numpy?

Interfacing to Fortran:
-----------------------
The clear choice to wrap Fortran code is
`f2py <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/>`_.

Pyfort is an older alternative, but not supported any longer.
Fwrap is a newer project that looked promising but isn't being developed any
longer.

Interfacing to C++:
-------------------
 1) Cython
 2) CXX
 3) Boost.python
 4) SWIG
 5) SIP (used mainly in PyQT)
