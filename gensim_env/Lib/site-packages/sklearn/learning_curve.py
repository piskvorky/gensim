    .. deprecated:: 0.18
        This module will be removed in 0.20.
        Use :func:`sklearn.model_selection.learning_curve` instead.

    Determines cross-validated training and test scores for different training
    set sizes.

    A cross-validation generator splits the whole dataset k times in training
    and test data. Subsets of the training set with varying sizes will be used
    to train the estimator and a score for each training subset size and the
    test set will be computed. Afterwards, the scores will be averaged over
    all k runs for each training subset size.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <learning_curves>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object type that implements the "fit" and "predict" methods
        An object of that type which is cloned for each validation.

    X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training vector, where n_samples is the number of samples and
        n_features is the number of features.

    y : array-like, shape (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_features), optional
        Target relative to X for classification or regression;
        None for unsupervised learning.

    train_sizes : array-like, shape (n_ticks,), dtype float or int
        Relative or absolute numbers of training examples that will be used to
        generate the learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a
        fraction of the maximum size of the training set (that is determined
        by the selected validation method), i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].
        Otherwise it is interpreted as absolute sizes of the training sets.
        Note that for classification the number of samples usually have to
        be big enough to contain at least one sample from each class.
        (default: np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 5))

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
        - An iterable yielding train/test splits.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass,
        :class:`sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`sklearn.model_selection.KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    scoring : string, callable or None, optional, default: None
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

    exploit_incremental_learning : boolean, optional, default: False
        If the estimator supports incremental learning, this will be
        used to speed up fitting for different training set sizes.

    n_jobs : integer, optional
        Number of jobs to run in parallel (default 1).

    pre_dispatch : integer or string, optional
        Number of predispatched jobs for parallel execution (default is
        all). The option can reduce the allocated memory. The string can
        be an expression like '2*n_jobs'.

    verbose : integer, optional
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error.

    Returns
    -------
    train_sizes_abs : array, shape = (n_unique_ticks,), dtype int
        Numbers of training examples that has been used to generate the
        learning curve. Note that the number of ticks might be less
        than n_ticks because duplicate entries will be removed.

    train_scores : array, shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Scores on training sets.

    test_scores : array, shape (n_ticks, n_cv_folds)
        Scores on test set.
