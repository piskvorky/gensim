class IncrementalPCA(_BasePCA):
    """Incremental principal components analysis (IPCA).

    Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of
    centered data, keeping only the most significant singular vectors to
    project the data to a lower dimensional space.

    Depending on the size of the input data, this algorithm can be much more
    memory efficient than a PCA.

    This algorithm has constant memory complexity, on the order
    of ``batch_size``, enabling use of np.memmap files without loading the
    entire file into memory.

    The computational overhead of each SVD is
    ``O(batch_size * n_features ** 2)``, but only 2 * batch_size samples
    remain in memory at a time. There will be ``n_samples / batch_size`` SVD
    computations to get the principal components, versus 1 large SVD of
    complexity ``O(n_samples * n_features ** 2)`` for PCA.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <IncrementalPCA>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int or None, (default=None)
        Number of components to keep. If ``n_components `` is ``None``,
        then ``n_components`` is set to ``min(n_samples, n_features)``.

    whiten : bool, optional
        When True (False by default) the ``components_`` vectors are divided
        by ``n_samples`` times ``components_`` to ensure uncorrelated outputs
        with unit component-wise variances.

        Whitening will remove some information from the transformed signal
        (the relative variance scales of the components) but can sometimes
        improve the predictive accuracy of the downstream estimators by
        making data respect some hard-wired assumptions.

    copy : bool, (default=True)
        If False, X will be overwritten. ``copy=False`` can be used to
        save memory but is unsafe for general use.

    batch_size : int or None, (default=None)
        The number of samples to use for each batch. Only used when calling
        ``fit``. If ``batch_size`` is ``None``, then ``batch_size``
        is inferred from the data and set to ``5 * n_features``, to provide a
        balance between approximation accuracy and memory consumption.

    Attributes
    ----------
    components_ : array, shape (n_components, n_features)
        Components with maximum variance.

    explained_variance_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        Variance explained by each of the selected components.

    explained_variance_ratio_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        Percentage of variance explained by each of the selected components.
        If all components are stored, the sum of explained variances is equal
        to 1.0.

    singular_values_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        The singular values corresponding to each of the selected components.
        The singular values are equal to the 2-norms of the ``n_components``
        variables in the lower-dimensional space.

    mean_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Per-feature empirical mean, aggregate over calls to ``partial_fit``.

    var_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Per-feature empirical variance, aggregate over calls to
        ``partial_fit``.

    noise_variance_ : float
        The estimated noise covariance following the Probabilistic PCA model
        from Tipping and Bishop 1999. See "Pattern Recognition and
        Machine Learning" by C. Bishop, 12.2.1 p. 574 or
        http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf.

    n_components_ : int
        The estimated number of components. Relevant when
        ``n_components=None``.

    n_samples_seen_ : int
        The number of samples processed by the estimator. Will be reset on
        new calls to fit, but increments across ``partial_fit`` calls.

    Notes
    -----
    Implements the incremental PCA model from:
    `D. Ross, J. Lim, R. Lin, M. Yang, Incremental Learning for Robust Visual
    Tracking, International Journal of Computer Vision, Volume 77, Issue 1-3,
    pp. 125-141, May 2008.`
    See http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dross/ivt/RossLimLinYang_ijcv.pdf

    This model is an extension of the Sequential Karhunen-Loeve Transform from:
    `A. Levy and M. Lindenbaum, Sequential Karhunen-Loeve Basis Extraction and
    its Application to Images, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Volume 9,
    Number 8, pp. 1371-1374, August 2000.`
    See http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~mic/doc/skl-ip.pdf

    We have specifically abstained from an optimization used by authors of both
    papers, a QR decomposition used in specific situations to reduce the
    algorithmic complexity of the SVD. The source for this technique is
    `Matrix Computations, Third Edition, G. Holub and C. Van Loan, Chapter 5,
    section 5.4.4, pp 252-253.`. This technique has been omitted because it is
    advantageous only when decomposing a matrix with ``n_samples`` (rows)
    >= 5/3 * ``n_features`` (columns), and hurts the readability of the
    implemented algorithm. This would be a good opportunity for future
    optimization, if it is deemed necessary.
