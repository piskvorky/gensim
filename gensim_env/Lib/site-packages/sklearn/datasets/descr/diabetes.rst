Diabetes dataset
================

Notes
-----

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood
pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n =
442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a
quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Data Set Characteristics:

  :Number of Instances: 442

  :Number of Attributes: First 10 columns are numeric predictive values

  :Target: Column 11 is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline

  :Attributes:
    :Age:
    :Sex:
    :Body mass index:
    :Average blood pressure:
    :S1:
    :S2:
    :S3:
    :S4:
    :S5:
    :S6:

Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times `n_samples` (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
