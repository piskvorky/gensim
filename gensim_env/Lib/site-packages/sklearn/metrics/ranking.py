    drop_intermediate : boolean, optional (default=True)

def label_ranking_average_precision_score(y_true, y_score):
    """Compute ranking-based average precision

    Label ranking average precision (LRAP) is the average over each ground
    truth label assigned to each sample, of the ratio of true vs. total
    labels with lower score.

    This metric is used in multilabel ranking problem, where the goal
    is to give better rank to the labels associated to each sample.

    The obtained score is always strictly greater than 0 and
    the best value is 1.

    """Coverage error measure

    Compute how far we need to go through the ranked scores to cover all
    true labels. The best value is equal to the average number
    of labels in ``y_true`` per sample.

    Ties in ``y_scores`` are broken by giving maximal rank that would have
    been assigned to all tied values.

    Note: Our implementation's score is 1 greater than the one given in
    Tsoumakas et al., 2010. This extends it to handle the degenerate case
    in which an instance has 0 true labels.
