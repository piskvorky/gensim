def adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred):
    """Rand index adjusted for chance.

    The Rand Index computes a similarity measure between two clusterings
    by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are
    assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and
    true clusterings.

    The raw RI score is then "adjusted for chance" into the ARI score
    using the following scheme::

        ARI = (RI - Expected_RI) / (max(RI) - Expected_RI)

    The adjusted Rand index is thus ensured to have a value close to
    0.0 for random labeling independently of the number of clusters and
    samples and exactly 1.0 when the clusterings are identical (up to
    a permutation).

    ARI is a symmetric measure::

        adjusted_rand_score(a, b) == adjusted_rand_score(b, a)

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <adjusted_rand_score>`.

    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]
        Ground truth class labels to be used as a reference

    labels_pred : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Cluster labels to evaluate

    Returns
    -------
    ari : float
       Similarity score between -1.0 and 1.0. Random labelings have an ARI
       close to 0.0. 1.0 stands for perfect match.

    Examples
    --------

    Perfectly matching labelings have a score of 1 even

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import adjusted_rand_score
      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      1.0
      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    Labelings that assign all classes members to the same clusters
    are complete be not always pure, hence penalized::

      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1])  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.57...

    ARI is symmetric, so labelings that have pure clusters with members
    coming from the same classes but unnecessary splits are penalized::

      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2])  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.57...

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters, the
    assignment is totally incomplete, hence the ARI is very low::

      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])

def adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred):
    """Adjusted Mutual Information between two clusterings.

    Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) is an adjustment of the Mutual
    Information (MI) score to account for chance. It accounts for the fact that
    the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number of
    clusters, regardless of whether there is actually more information shared.
    For two clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V`, the AMI is given as::

        AMI(U, V) = [MI(U, V) - E(MI(U, V))] / [max(H(U), H(V)) - E(MI(U, V))]

    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the
    score value in any way.

    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with
    ``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to
    measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies
    on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known.

    Be mindful that this function is an order of magnitude slower than other
    metrics, such as the Adjusted Rand Index.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <mutual_info_score>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

    labels_pred : array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

    Returns
    -------
    ami: float(upperlimited by 1.0)
       The AMI returns a value of 1 when the two partitions are identical
       (ie perfectly matched). Random partitions (independent labellings) have
       an expected AMI around 0 on average hence can be negative.

    See also
    --------
    adjusted_rand_score: Adjusted Rand Index
    mutual_information_score: Mutual Information (not adjusted for chance)

    Examples
    --------

    Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have
    score 1.0::

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import adjusted_mutual_info_score
      >>> adjusted_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      1.0
      >>> adjusted_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters,
    the assignment is totally in-complete, hence the AMI is null::

      >>> adjusted_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
      0.0

    Where ``TP`` is the number of **True Positive** (i.e. the number of pair of
