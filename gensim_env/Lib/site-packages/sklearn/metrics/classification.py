    labels : list, optional
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,

           parameter *labels* improved for multiclass problem.

    pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : string, [None, 'binary' (default), 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', \

        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    f1_score : float or array of float, shape = [n_unique_labels]

    that is negative.

            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.

            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    -------

        [n_unique_labels]
        The number of occurrences of each label in ``y_true``.

        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : list, optional
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           parameter *labels* improved for multiclass problem.

    pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : string, [None, 'binary' (default), 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', \
                       'weighted']
        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    precision : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        Precision of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the precision of each class for the multiclass task.

    Notes
    -----
    In multiclass classification, the Hamming loss correspond to the Hamming
    distance between ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` which is equivalent to the
    subset ``zero_one_loss`` function.

    In multilabel classification, the Hamming loss is different from the
    subset zero-one loss. The zero-one loss considers the entire set of labels
    for a given sample incorrect if it does entirely match the true set of
    labels. Hamming loss is more forgiving in that it penalizes the individual
    labels.

    The Hamming loss is upperbounded by the subset zero-one loss. When

    """Average hinge loss (non-regularized)

    In binary class case, assuming labels in y_true are encoded with +1 and -1,
    when a prediction mistake is made, ``margin = y_true * pred_decision`` is
    always negative (since the signs disagree), implying ``1 - margin`` is
    always greater than 1.  The cumulated hinge loss is therefore an upper
    bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.

    In multiclass case, the function expects that either all the labels are
    included in y_true or an optional labels argument is provided which
    contains all the labels. The multilabel margin is calculated according
    to Crammer-Singer's method. As in the binary case, the cumulated hinge loss
    is an upper bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True target, consisting of integers of two values. The positive label
        must be greater than the negative label.

    pred_decision : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        Predicted decisions, as output by decision_function (floats).

    labels : array, optional, default None
        Contains all the labels for the problem. Used in multiclass hinge loss.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional

    The smaller the Brier score, the better, hence the naming with "loss".

    Across all items in a set N predictions, the Brier score measures the
    mean squared difference between (1) the predicted probability assigned
    to the possible outcomes for item i, and (2) the actual outcome.
    Therefore, the lower the Brier score is for a set of predictions, the
    better the predictions are calibrated. Note that the Brier score always
    takes on a value between zero and one, since this is the largest
    possible difference between a predicted probability (which must be
    between zero and one) and the actual outcome (which can take on values
    of only 0 and 1).

    The Brier score is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that
    can be structured as true or false, but is inappropriate for ordinal
    variables which can take on three or more values (this is because the
    Brier score assumes that all possible outcomes are equivalently
    "distant" from one another). Which label is considered to be the positive
    label is controlled via the parameter pos_label, which defaults to 1.
