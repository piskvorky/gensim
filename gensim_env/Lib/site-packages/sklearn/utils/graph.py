def single_source_shortest_path_length(graph, source, cutoff=None):
    """Return the shortest path length from source to all reachable nodes.

    Returns a dictionary of shortest path lengths keyed by target.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : sparse matrix or 2D array (preferably LIL matrix)
        Adjacency matrix of the graph
    source : node label
       Starting node for path
    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth to stop the search - only
        paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.utils.graph import single_source_shortest_path_length
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> graph = np.array([[ 0, 1, 0, 0],
    ...                   [ 1, 0, 1, 0],
