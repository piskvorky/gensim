Simplex representation
======================
The simplices (triangles, tetrahedra, ...) appearing in the Delaunay
tesselation (N-dim simplices), convex hull facets, and Voronoi ridges
(N-1 dim simplices) are represented in the following scheme::

    tess = Delaunay(points)
    hull = ConvexHull(points)
    voro = Voronoi(points)

    # coordinates of the j-th vertex of the i-th simplex
    tess.points[tess.simplices[i, j], :]        # tesselation element
    hull.points[hull.simplices[i, j], :]        # convex hull facet
    voro.vertices[voro.ridge_vertices[i, j], :] # ridge between Voronoi cells

For Delaunay triangulations and convex hulls, the neighborhood
structure of the simplices satisfies the condition:

    ``tess.neighbors[i,j]`` is the neighboring simplex of the i-th
    simplex, opposite to the j-vertex. It is -1 in case of no
    neighbor.

Convex hull facets also define a hyperplane equation::

    (hull.equations[i,:-1] * coord).sum() + hull.equations[i,-1] == 0

Similar hyperplane equations for the Delaunay triangulation correspond
to the convex hull facets on the corresponding N+1 dimensional
paraboloid.

The Delaunay triangulation objects offer a method for locating the
simplex containing a given point, and barycentric coordinate
computations.
