def linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix):
    """Solve the linear sum assignment problem.

    The linear sum assignment problem is also known as minimum weight matching
    in bipartite graphs. A problem instance is described by a matrix C, where
    each C[i,j] is the cost of matching vertex i of the first partite set
    (a "worker") and vertex j of the second set (a "job"). The goal is to find
    a complete assignment of workers to jobs of minimal cost.

    Formally, let X be a boolean matrix where :math:`X[i,j] = 1` iff row i is
    assigned to column j. Then the optimal assignment has cost

    .. math::
        \\min \\sum_i \\sum_j C_{i,j} X_{i,j}

    s.t. each row is assignment to at most one column, and each column to at
    most one row.

    This function can also solve a generalization of the classic assignment
    problem where the cost matrix is rectangular. If it has more rows than
    columns, then not every row needs to be assigned to a column, and vice
    versa.

    The method used is the Hungarian algorithm, also known as the Munkres or
    Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost_matrix : array
        The cost matrix of the bipartite graph.

    Returns
    -------
    row_ind, col_ind : array
        An array of row indices and one of corresponding column indices giving
        the optimal assignment. The cost of the assignment can be computed
        as ``cost_matrix[row_ind, col_ind].sum()``. The row indices will be
        sorted; in the case of a square cost matrix they will be equal to
        ``numpy.arange(cost_matrix.shape[0])``.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 0.17.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> cost = np.array([[4, 1, 3], [2, 0, 5], [3, 2, 2]])
    >>> from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment
    >>> row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)
    >>> col_ind
    array([1, 0, 2])
    >>> cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()
    5
