        :param num_cb: (optional) If a callback is specified with the cb
            parameter, this parameter determines the granularity of the callback
            by defining the maximum number of times the callback will be called
            during the file transfer.

        :type policy: :class:`boto.gs.acl.CannedACLStrings`
        :param policy: (optional) A canned ACL policy that will be applied to
            the new key in GS.

        :type md5: tuple
        :param md5: (optional) A tuple containing the hexdigest version of the
            MD5 checksum of the file as the first element and the
            Base64-encoded version of the plain checksum as the second element.
            This is the same format returned by the compute_md5 method.

            If you need to compute the MD5 for any reason prior to upload, it's
            silly to have to do it twice so this param, if present, will be
            used as the MD5 values of the file. Otherwise, the checksum will be
            computed.

            perform the upload.

        :type size: int
        :param size: (optional) The Maximum number of bytes to read from the
            file pointer (fp). This is useful when uploading a file in multiple
            parts where you are splitting the file up into different ranges to
            be uploaded. If not specified, the default behaviour is to read all
            bytes from the file pointer. Less bytes may be available.

            Notes:

                1. The "size" parameter currently cannot be used when a
                   resumable upload handler is given but is still useful for
                   uploading part of a file as implemented by the parent class.
                2. At present Google Cloud Storage does not support multipart
                   uploads.

        :type rewind: bool
        :param rewind: (optional) If True, the file pointer (fp) will be
            rewound to the start before any bytes are read from it. The default
            behaviour is False which reads from the current position of the
            file pointer (fp).

        :type if_generation: int
        :param if_generation: (optional) If set to a generation number, the
            object will only be written to if its current generation number is
            this value. If set to the value 0, the object will only be written
            if it doesn't already exist.

        :rtype: int
        :return: The number of bytes written to the key.

        to move functionality common to all providers into a parent class,
