What?
=====

``smart_open`` is a Python 2 & Python 3 library for **efficient streaming of very large files** from/to S3, HDFS, WebHDFS, HTTP, or local (compressed) files.
It is well tested (using `moto <https://github.com/spulec/moto>`_), well documented and sports a simple, Pythonic API:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> # stream lines from an S3 object
  >>> for line in smart_open.smart_open('s3://mybucket/mykey.txt'):
  ...    print line

  >>> # using a completely custom s3 server, like s3proxy:
  >>> for line in smart_open.smart_open('s3u://user:secret@host:port@mybucket/mykey.txt'):
  ...    print line

  >>> # you can also use a boto.s3.key.Key instance directly:
  >>> key = boto.connect_s3().get_bucket("my_bucket").get_key("my_key")
  >>> with smart_open.smart_open(key) as fin:
  ...     for line in fin:
  ...         print line

  >>> # can use context managers too:
  >>> with smart_open.smart_open('s3://mybucket/mykey.txt') as fin:
  ...     for line in fin:
  ...         print line
  ...     fin.seek(0)  # seek to the beginning
  ...     print fin.read(1000)  # read 1000 bytes

  >>> # stream from HDFS
  >>> for line in smart_open.smart_open('hdfs://user/hadoop/my_file.txt'):
  ...     print line

  >>> # stream from HTTP
  >>> for line in smart_open.smart_open('http://example.com/index.html'):
  ...     print line

  >>> # stream from WebHDFS
  >>> for line in smart_open.smart_open('webhdfs://host:port/user/hadoop/my_file.txt'):
  ...     print line

  >>> # stream content *into* S3 (write mode):
  >>> with smart_open.smart_open('s3://mybucket/mykey.txt', 'wb') as fout:
  ...     for line in ['first line', 'second line', 'third line']:
  ...          fout.write(line + '\n')

  >>> # stream content *into* HDFS (write mode):
  >>> with smart_open.smart_open('hdfs://host:port/user/hadoop/my_file.txt', 'wb') as fout:
  ...     for line in ['first line', 'second line', 'third line']:
  ...          fout.write(line + '\n')

  >>> # stream content *into* WebHDFS (write mode):
  >>> with smart_open.smart_open('webhdfs://host:port/user/hadoop/my_file.txt', 'wb') as fout:
  ...     for line in ['first line', 'second line', 'third line']:
  ...          fout.write(line + '\n')

  >>> # stream from/to local compressed files:
  >>> for line in smart_open.smart_open('./foo.txt.gz'):
  ...    print line

  >>> with smart_open.smart_open('/home/radim/foo.txt.bz2', 'wb') as fout:
  ...    fout.write("some content\n")

Since going over all (or select) keys in an S3 bucket is a very common operation,
there's also an extra method ``smart_open.s3_iter_bucket()`` that does this efficiently,
**processing the bucket keys in parallel** (using multiprocessing):

.. code-block:: python

  >>> # get all JSON files under "mybucket/foo/"
  >>> bucket = boto.connect_s3().get_bucket('mybucket')
  >>> for key, content in s3_iter_bucket(bucket, prefix='foo/', accept_key=lambda key: key.endswith('.json')):
  ...     print key, len(content)

For more info (S3 credentials in URI, minimum S3 part size...) and full method signatures, check out the API docs:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import smart_open
  >>> help(smart_open.smart_open_lib)

S3-Specific Options
-------------------

There are a few optional keyword arguments that are useful only for S3 access.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> smart_open.smart_open('s3://', host='s3.amazonaws.com')
  >>> smart_open.smart_open('s3://', profile_name='my-profile')

These are both passed to `boto.s3_connect()` as keyword arguments.
The S3 reader supports gzipped content, as long as the key is obviously a gzipped file (e.g. ends with ".gz").

Why?
----

Working with large S3 files using Amazon's default Python library, `boto <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/>`_, is a pain. Its ``key.set_contents_from_string()`` and ``key.get_contents_as_string()`` methods only work for small files (loaded in RAM, no streaming).
There are nasty hidden gotchas when using ``boto``'s multipart upload functionality, and a lot of boilerplate.

``smart_open`` shields you from that. It builds on boto but offers a cleaner API. The result is less code for you to write and fewer bugs to make.

Installation
------------
::

    pip install smart_open

Or, if you prefer to install from the `source tar.gz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/smart_open>`_::

    python setup.py test  # run unit tests
    python setup.py install

To run the unit tests (optional), you'll also need to install `mock <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock>`_ , `moto <https://github.com/spulec/moto>`_ and `responses <https://github.com/getsentry/responses>` (``pip install mock moto responses``). The tests are also run automatically with `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open>`_ on every commit push & pull request.

Todo
----

``smart_open`` is an ongoing effort. Suggestions, pull request and improvements welcome!

On the roadmap:

* better documentation for the default ``file://`` scheme
