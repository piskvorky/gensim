        # We want the _oldest_ possible manylinux version to ensure our
        # wheels work on the widest possible range of distros.  Version 1
        # seems to break for certain Python versions under Linux and Windows,
        # so we use 2010, which is the next oldest.
        #
        # When selecting the numpy version to build against, we need to satisfy
        # two conditions.  First, we want the wheel to be available for the
        # version of Python we're building against, because building numpy
        # wheels on our own is too much work.
        #
        # Second, in order to guarantee compatibility with the greatest range
        # of numpy versions, we want to build against the oldest possible numpy
        # version, as long as it's 1.17.0 or newer.  Building versions earlier
        # than 1.17.0 yields wheels that are incompatible with some newer
        # versions of numpy.  See https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/issues/3226
        # for details.
        #
        # The logic for numpy version selection is based on
        # https://github.com/scipy/oldest-supported-numpy/blob/master/setup.cfg
        # with the exception that we enforce the minimum version to be 1.17.0.
