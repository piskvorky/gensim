0.8.1, 10/10/2011

* transactional similarity server: see docs/simserver.html
* website moved from university hosting to radimrehurek.com
* much improved speed of lsi[corpus] transformation:
* accuracy tests of incremental svd: test/svd_error.py and http://groups.google.com/group/gensim/browse_thread/thread/4b605b72f8062770
* further improvements to memory-efficiency of LDA and LSA

* added support for similarity querying more documents at once (index[query_documents] in addition to index[query_document]; much faster)
* rewrote Similarity so that it is more efficient and scalable (using disk-based mmap'ed shards)
* simplified directory structure (src/gensim/ is now only gensim/)
* several small fixes and optimizations

0.7.8, 26/03/2011

* added `corpora.IndexedCorpus`, a base class for corpus serializers (thx to Dieter Plaetinck). This allows corpus formats that inherit from it (MmCorpus, SvmLightCorpus, BleiCorpus etc.) to retrieve individual documents by their id in O(1), e.g. `corpus[14]` returns document #14.
* merged new code from the LarKC.eu team (`corpora.textcorpus`, `models.logentropy_model`, lots of unit tests etc.)
* fixed a bug in `lda[bow]` transformation (was returning gamma distribution instead of theta). LDA model generation was not affected, only transforming new vectors.

* new LDA implementation after Hoffman et al.: Online Learning for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
* distributed LDA
* updated LDA docs (wiki experiments, distributed tutorial)

0.7.6, 10/01/2011

* added workaround for a bug in numpy: pickling a fortran-order array (e.g. LSA model) and then loading it back and using it results in segfault (thx to Brian Merrel)
* bundled a new version of ez_setup.py: old failed with Python2.6 when setuptools were missing (thx to Alan Salmoni).

0.7.5, 03/11/2010

* further optimization to LSA; this is the version used in my NIPS workshop paper
* got rid of SVDLIBC dependency (one-pass LSA now uses stochastic algo for base-base decompositions)

0.7.4

* sped up Latent Dirichlet ~10x (through scipy.weave, optional)
* finally, distributed LDA! scales almost linearly, but no tutorial yet. see the tutorial on distributed LSI, everything's completely analogous.
* several minor fixes and improvements; one nasty bug fixed (lsi[corpus] didn't work; thx to Danilo Spinelli)

0.7.3

* added stochastic SVD decomposition (faster than the current one-pass LSI algo, but needs two passes over the input corpus)
* published gensim on mloss.org

0.7.2

* added workaround for a numpy bug where SVD sometimes fails to converge for no good reason
* changed content of gensims's PyPi title page
* completed HTML tutorial on distributed LSA

* optimized vocabulary generation in gensim.corpora.dictionary (faster and less memory-intense)
* MmCorpus accepts compressed input (file-like objects such as GzipFile, BZ2File; to save disk space)
* changed sparse solver to SVDLIBC (sparsesvd on PyPi) for large document chunks
* added distributed LSA, updated tutorials (still experimental though)
* several minor bug fixes

0.6.0

* added option for online LSI training (yay!). the transformation can now be
  used after any amount of training, and training can be continued at any time
  with more data.
* optimized the tf-idf transformation, so that it is a strictly one-pass algorithm in all cases  (thx to Brian Merrell).
* fixed Windows-specific bug in handling binary files (thx to Sutee Sudprasert)
* fixed 1-based feature counting bug in SVMlight format (thx to Richard Berendsen)

0.4.2

* First version
