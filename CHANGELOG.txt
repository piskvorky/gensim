Changes
=======

0.6.0

* optimized the tf-idf transformation, so that it is a strictly one-pass algorithm  (thx to Brian Merrell).
* added 'Topic :: Text Processing :: Linguistic' to gensim's pypi classifiers
* added option for online training to LSI. The transformation can now be
  used after any amount of training, and training can be continued at any time 
  with more data, in a truly streaming fashion.
* fixed Windows-specific bug in handling binary files (thx to Sutee Sudprasert)
* fixed 1-based feature counting bug in SVMlight format (thx to Richard Berendsen)

0.5.0

* finished all tutorials, stable version

0.4.7

* tutorial on transformations

0.4.6

* several DML-CZ specific updates

0.4.5

* updated documentation
* further memory optimizations in SVD (LSI)

0.4.4

* added missing test files to MANIFEST.in

0.4.3

* documentation changes

0.4.2

* finally, a tutorial!
