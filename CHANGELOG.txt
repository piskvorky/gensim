Changes
=======

0.12.3, 06/11/2015

* Make show_topics return value consistent across models (Christopher Corley, #448)
  - All models with the `show_topics` method should return a list of
    `(topic_number, topic)` tuples, where `topic` is a list of
    `(word, probability)` tuples.
  - This is a breaking change that affects users of the `LsiModel`, `LdaModel`,
  and `LdaMulticore` that may be reliant on the old tuple layout of
  `(probability, word)`.
* Mixed integer & string document-tags (keys to doc-vectors) will work (Gordon Mohr, #491)
  - DocvecsArray's `index2doctag` list is renamed/reinterpreted as `offset2doctag`
  - `offset2doctag` entries map to `doctag_syn0` indexes *after* last plain-int doctag (if any)
  - (If using only string doctags, `offset2doctag` may be interpreted same as `index2doctag`.)
* New Tutorials on Dynamic Topic Modelling and Classification via Word2Vec (@arttii #471, @mataddy #500)
* Auto-learning for the eta parameter on the LdaModel (Christopher Corley, #479)

* tutorial on text summarization (Ólavur Mortensen, #436)

* added support for sliced TransformedCorpus objects, so that after applying (for instance) TfidfModel the returned corpus remains randomly indexable. (Matti Lyra, #425)
