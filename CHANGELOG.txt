Changes
=======
0.12.5, 2016
* added term-topics API for most probable topic for word in vocab. (@bhargavvader, #706)
* build_vocab takes progress_per parameter for smaller output (@zer0n, #624)
* Control whether to use lowercase for computing word2vec accuracy. (@alantian, #607)
* Easy import of GloVe vectors using Gensim (Manas Ranjan Kar, #625)
  - Allow easy port of GloVe vectors into Gensim
  - Standalone script with command line arguments, compatible with Python>=2.6 
  - Usage: python -m gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec -i glove_vectors.txt -o output_word2vec_compatible.txt
* Add `similar_by_word()` and `similar_by_vector()` to word2vec (@isohyt, #381)
* Convenience method for similarity of two out of training sentences to doc2vec (@ellolo, #707)
* Dynamic Topic Modelling Tutorial updated with Dynamic Influence Model (@bhargavvader, #689)

0.12.4, 29/01/2016
* Better internal handling of job batching in word2vec (#535)
  - up to 300% speed up when training on very short documents (~tweets)
* Word2vec CLI in line with original word2vec.c (Andrey Kutuzov, #538)
  - Same default values. See diff https://github.com/akutuzov/gensim/commit/6456cbcd75e6f8720451766ba31cc046b4463ae2
  - Standalone script with command line arguments matching those of original C tool.
  - Usage: python -m gensim.scripts.word2vec_standalone -train data.txt -output trained_vec.txt -size 200 -window 2 -sample 1e-4
* Improved load_word2vec_format() performance (@svenkreiss, #555)
  - Remove `init_sims()` call for performance improvements when normalized vectors are not needed.
  - Remove `norm_only` parameter (API change). Call `init_sims(replace=True)` after the `load_word2vec_format()` call for the old `norm_only=True` behavior.
* Word2vec allows non-strict unicode error handling (ignore or replace) (Gordon Mohr, #466)
* Doc2Vec `model.docvecs[key]` now raises KeyError for unknown keys (Gordon Mohr, #520)
* Fix `DocvecsArray.index_to_doctag` so `most_similar()` returns string doctags (Gordon Mohr, #560)
* On-demand loading of the `pattern` library in utils.lemmatize (Jan Zikes, #461)
  - `utils.HAS_PATTERN` flag moved to `utils.has_pattern()`
* Threadsafe Word2Vec/Doc2Vec finish-check to avoid hang/unending Word2Vec/Doc2Vec training (Gordon Mohr, #571)
* Tuned `TestWord2VecModel.test_cbow_hs()` against random failures (Gordon Mohr, #531)
* Prevent ZeroDivisionError when `default_timer()` indicate no elapsed time (Gordon Mohr, #518)
* Forwards compatibility for NumPy > 1.10 (Matti Lyra, #494, #513)
  - LdaModel and LdaMulticore produce a large number of DeprecationWarnings from
    .inference() because the term ids in each chunk returned from utils.grouper
    are floats. This behaviour has been changed so that the term IDs are now ints.
  - utils.grouper returns a python list instead of a numpy array in .update() when
    LdaModel is called in non distributed mode
  - in distributed mode .update() will still call utils.grouper with as_numpy=True
    to save memory
  - LdaModel.update and LdaMulticore.update have a new keyword parameter
    chunks_as_numpy=True/False (defaults to False) that allows controlling
    this behaviour

0.12.3, 05/11/2015

* Make show_topics return value consistent across models (Christopher Corley, #448)
  - All models with the `show_topics` method should return a list of
    `(topic_number, topic)` tuples, where `topic` is a list of
    `(word, probability)` tuples.
  - This is a breaking change that affects users of the `LsiModel`, `LdaModel`,
  and `LdaMulticore` that may be reliant on the old tuple layout of
  `(probability, word)`.
* Mixed integer & string document-tags (keys to doc-vectors) will work (Gordon Mohr, #491)
  - DocvecsArray's `index2doctag` list is renamed/reinterpreted as `offset2doctag`
  - `offset2doctag` entries map to `doctag_syn0` indexes *after* last plain-int doctag (if any)
  - (If using only string doctags, `offset2doctag` may be interpreted same as `index2doctag`.)
* New Tutorials on Dynamic Topic Modelling and Classification via Word2Vec (@arttii #471, @mataddy #500)
* Auto-learning for the eta parameter on the LdaModel (Christopher Corley, #479)
* Python 3.5 support
* Speed improvements to keyword and summarisation methods (@erbas #441)
* OSX wheels (#504)
* Win build (#492)

* tutorial on text summarization (Ólavur Mortensen, #436)
* more flexible vocabulary construction in word2vec & doc2vec (Philipp Dowling, #434)
* added support for sliced TransformedCorpus objects, so that after applying (for instance) TfidfModel the returned corpus remains randomly indexable. (Matti Lyra, #425)
