    List_Of_Words corpus handles input in GibbsLda++ format.
    
    Quoting http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/#3.2_Input_Data_Format::
    
        Both data for training/estimating the model and new data (i.e., previously 
        unseen data) have the same format as follows:
    
        [M]
        [document1]
        [document2]
        ...
        [documentM]
    
        in which the first line is the total number for documents [M]. Each line 
        after that is one document. [documenti] is the ith document of the dataset 
        that consists of a list of Ni words/terms.
    
        [documenti] = [wordi1] [wordi2] ... [wordiNi]
    
        in which all [wordij] (i=1..M, j=1..Ni) are text strings and they are separated 
        by the blank character.
